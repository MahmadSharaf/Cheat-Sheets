## What is a product manager

- Product Managers must:
  - Deep understanding of the problem
  - Understand user needs
  - Know their product
  - Know the competition
- Product Managers spend a lot of their time:
  - Identifying/defining problems
  - Creating a strategy
  - Communicating
  - Coordinating development
  - Responding to fires
- Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:
  - What are we building?
  - Who are we building this for?
  - Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
  - When are we building this?
- Product Managers should be:
  - Strategic
  - Hyper aware of their user needs
  - Intuitive regarding their users' response towards new features or changes in the product.
  - Capable of getting the product to its full potential and vision while in building process.
  - Source of truth for the current product state.
  - Able to easily translate between different audiences, while communicating product details.
- Everything will not be build at once, so it is important to prioritize what to build first and what will go on the roadmap later. This needs to be answered in a strategic manner that tie back to business goals and objectives.

## Why Product Management is Important

- Products became so complicated
- Making sure that the products being built are the ones the people want
- Aligning with all teams needed to build and launch the product

## Product Manager role

- At its very core, the role of the PM is to make sure that the team is solving the right problems and building the right products.
- PMs take care of the product from an idea all the way through launch.
- Due to limited resources, they prioritize their roadmap. This often involves weighing several different tradeoffs.
- There is a misconception that PM in a position to take all the decisions, while the truth is that PM doesn't have a direct authority over other teams. However, he needs to influence, cooperate, drive the team to alignment on what the product should do and what should be built.
- Identify the problem, study its impact and the amount of effort to solve it. Solving the problem can lead to:
	- Make product more appealing
	- Increase sales
	- Reduce churn
	- Keep you competitive
	- Increase your team efficiency
	- Be required for legal compliance
- Be SPOC of their product. He should be able to answer any question related to their product or guide where to find the answer.
- Since PMs don't have direct authority, they need to persuade, convince, and secure buy-in from a variety of cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- They are responsible for coordinating the development of a product across all relevant parties like design, business, engineering, marketing, and support teams.

### Startup vs Enterprise

- The role of the PM can vary a lot based on the company size.
- At smaller companies, where it has broader focus, less support, and less process, it's more likely that PMs will have more end to end responsibility and wear more hats.
- Whereas at larger companies oftentimes there will be larger supporting teams, which allow PMs to maintain a narrow focus and go super deep on that specific area.

### Building philosophies

- Example:
	- Amazon same day shipping

#### Engineering-Driven

- Focus on solving technical problems.
- Engineers build things and then hand them off to the PM.
- The PM role is to figure out the technology and bring it to the market.

	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer
- Example:
	- Google Glass

#### Hybrid-Driven

- PMs write the requirements, but the engineers are included in identifying the requirements. Engineers build based on the requirements, but PMs are included in engineering design.
- Pros:
