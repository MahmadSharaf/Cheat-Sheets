# Product Management Nanodegree by Udacity

## What is a product manager

- Product Managers must:
  - Deep understanding of the problem
  - Understand user needs
  - Know their product
  - Know the competition
- Product Managers spend a lot of their time:
  - Identifying/defining problems
  - Creating a strategy
  - Communicating All the time
- Coordinating development and launch
  - Responding to fires
	  - PMs need to be able to juggle multiple tasks and quickly switch focus when priorities change, (i.e. there is an outage).
- Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:
  - What are we building?
  - Who are we building this for?
  - Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
  - When are we building this?
- Product Managers should be:
  - Strategic
  - Hyper aware of their user needs
  - Intuitive regarding their users' response towards new features or changes in the product.
  - Capable of getting the product to its full potential and vision while in building process.
  - Source of truth for the current product state.
  - Able to easily translate between different audiences, while communicating product details.
- Everything will not be build at once, so it is important to prioritize what to build first and what will go on the roadmap later. This needs to be answered in a strategic manner that tie back to business goals and objectives.

## Why Product Management is Important

- Products became so complicated
- Making sure that the products being built are the ones the people want
- Aligning with all teams needed to build and launch the product

## Product Manager role

- At its very core, the role of the PM is to make sure that the team is solving the right problems and building the right products.
- PMs take care of the product from an idea all the way through launch.
- Due to limited resources, they prioritize their roadmap. This often involves weighing several different tradeoffs.
- There is a misconception that PM in a position to take all the decisions, while the truth is that PM doesn't have a direct authority over other teams. However, he needs to influence, cooperate, drive the team to alignment on what the product should do and what should be built.
- Identify the problem, study its impact and the amount of effort to solve it. Solving the problem can lead to:
	- Make product more appealing
	- Increase sales
	- Reduce churn
	- Keep you competitive
	- Increase your team efficiency
	- Be required for legal compliance
- Be SPOC of their product. He should be able to answer any question related to their product or guide where to find the answer.
- Since PMs don't have direct authority, they need to persuade, convince, and secure buy-in from a variety of cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- They are responsible for coordinating the development of a product across all relevant parties like design, business, engineering, marketing, and support teams.
- They need to make sure that the entire team is on the same page through presentations or conversations.
- PMs write PRDs to frame the problem and document requirements for the solution.

### Startup vs Enterprise

- The role of the PM can vary a lot based on the company size.
- At smaller companies, where it has broader focus, less support, and less process, it's more likely that PMs will have more end to end responsibility and wear more hats.
- Whereas at larger companies oftentimes there will be larger supporting teams, which allow PMs to maintain a narrow focus and go super deep on that specific area.

### Building philosophies

#### Product-Driven

- Focus on solving problems for users.
- The PM role is to identify and write the requirements and then hand them off to engineers.
- The engineers build based on these requirements
- Pros:
	- Customer centric approach
	- Build what customer want
- Cons:
	- Lack empathy from non-customer-facing teams
- Example:
	- Amazon same day shipping

#### Engineering-Driven

- Focus on solving technical problems.
- Engineers build things and then hand them off to the PM.
- The PM role is to figure out the technology and bring it to the market.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer
- Example:
	- Google Glass

#### Hybrid-Driven

- PMs write the requirements, but the engineers are included in identifying the requirements. Engineers build based on the requirements, but PMs are included in engineering design.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer

### Type of Product User

#### Consumer (B2C)

- Focus on user problems.
- Provides value for the user.
- User purchases the product.
- Faster pace of iteration.

#### Enterprise (B2B)

- Focus on business and user problems.
- Provides most value to the company and some value to the user.
- Business is the customer who purchases the product.
- Generally slower iteration.

### Type of products

#### Software

- PM focus on digital experience like apps and websites.
- PM need to understand roll-out cycles and process like App Store review.

#### Hardware

- PM focus on components, capabilities, cost, and supply chain.
- PM need to understand the build timelines, factory line setup, shipping certification and import implications.
- Physical products once built, it cannot be updated easily.

#### Data

- PM focus on building and power products, potentially through ML.
- PM need to understand data and numbers, to build products on top of data like Netflix recommendations and self-driving cars.

#### Growth

- PM focus on getting new users by growing the product through features that drive adoption, either directly or indirectly.
- PM need to understand funnel optimization, acquisition, and onboarding strategies.

#### Internationalization

- PM focus on brining the product to new places.
- PM need to understand the differences in those markets, differences in user behavior, and expectations and adopting the product to fit. Like adding feature to support RTL writing.

## Product phases

- Knowing that multiple products can be worked on at the same time at different phases

### Identifying problems and requirements

- Define the problem.
	- Although there are many problems, PM needs to identify which problem that deserves the effort.
- Deepen the understanding of the user and his needs
- Conduct market and user research
	- The PM can do that by user research, market research or competitive research to leverage existing product insights and data to create hypotheses and test them.
- User interviews
	- It helps to know the problems and issues directly from them.
- Stakeholder interviews
	- Helps to get a better understanding of the business objectives and requirements.
- Prototyping
	- Visualizing the UX can help in identifying gaps.
- Documentation
	- It is vital to document every step taken to identify the problem and the requirements, even the research and interviews.

### Creating Solutions

- Search for build strategies on how to solve the problem through creation of the product.
- The solution should be related with the company goals and KPIs.

### Timelines

- It is used to visualize tasks that need to be done to deliver the product. It presents task dependencies, resource allocations, workflows schedules, and deadlines.
- Timelines has a fixed start and end dates. It incorporates sprint cycles with the product's short time strategies.
- Assess the expected timelines according to the design and engineering teams feedback.
- If the product is large, it can be split into milestones. In which each milestone can be a standalone project and the following milestones will add more features into the project.
- Timelines components:
	1. Product Improvements
	2. Resources Management
	3. Risk Management
	4. Deadline

### [Roadmap][1]

- It identifies all the initiatives required for the creation and marketing of a product.
- It is mainly used to visualize product's strategy that is aligned with business goals.
- A roadmap streamlines business goals into strategic and executable paths.
- A roadmap can span across multiple timelines for continuous product development.
- A high-level roadmap explains the strategic course of action, with major milestones that you must complete to deliver your products on time.
- Roadmap components:
	1. Product Goal
	2. Strategic Objectives
	3. Major Features (Epics)
	4. Releases Plans
- Roadmap audiences are:
	- Senior management
	- External investors

### Product Requirement Document (PRD)

- PRD is the most important artifact in product cycle.
- It is the source of truth that answers all question related to:
	- What is being built?
	- Why is it needed?
	- Who is it being build for?
- It drives alignment between the team to reach the same final goal.
- PRD is never done, it is continuously updated as decisions are made and new information becomes available.
- PRD components:
	- Frame the problem
	- Outline the goals
	- Success Metrics
	- Describes the requirements
	- Assumptions
	- Out of scope
	- UI Mocks
	- Risks and Mitigations
	- Support Plan
- Priority Level needs to be mentioned, the below shorthand is common
	- P0: A launch blocking feature. The product will not launch without it
	- P1: A nice to have feature at launch, but not required. If not present at launch, it should be a fast follow
	- P2: A desirable feature
	- P3, P4: Unlikely to get built

### UX Design

- It is important to work closely with the product designer during wireframing.
- PM should provide context, requirements, visuals if possible, so the designer can take decisions. It is possible to provide design opinions and guidance, but it may not be always correct.
- Once the UX is ready, run usability testing to surface any issues. A/B testing can be better for small changes that usability testing will not fit.

### Implementation

- Make sure that engineering team fully understand the requirements.
- Cover and think of all possible edge cases.
- Get regular status updates to know whether the implementation is on track or the dates are slipping. This will surface any roadblocks that the team is running into so that you can help to remove them.

### Testing

- Review test plans with QA teams to outline which scenarios should be tested, the steps to be taken and the expected behavior.
- After QA team test the product, PM also should test it to find any bugs, and make sure that it meets the expected standards.

### Launch

- PM should work with the PR and marketing team to figure out how to launch the product.
- Launches can be silently or with big announcements by posting blog posts or held press conferences.
- For risks launches, it is advised to have a slow roll-out in phases. To have a chance to check the metrics and data.

### Review

- Check how the launch went. This can include different dimensions like changes in key metrics, users sentiments, or how the team thinks the launch went.
- Identify what can be learned and avoid any mistakes in future ones.
