# Product Management Nanodegree by Udacity

## Introduction to Product Management

### What is a product manager

- Product Managers must:
	- Have deep understanding of the problem
	- Understand user needs
	- Know their product
	- Know the competition
- Product Managers spend a lot of their time:
	- Identifying/defining problems
	- Creating a strategy
	- Communicating All the time
- Coordinating development and launch
	- Responding to fires
		- PMs need to be able to juggle multiple tasks and quickly switch focus when priorities change, (i.e. there is an outage).
- Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:
	 - What are we building?
	 - Who are we building this for?
	 - Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
	 - When are we building this?
- Product Managers should be:
	 - Strategic
	 - Hyper aware of their user needs
	 - Intuitive regarding their users' response towards new features or changes in the product.
	 - Capable of getting the product to its full potential and vision while in building process.
	 - Source of truth for the current product state.
	 - Able to easily translate between different audiences, while communicating product details.
- Everything will not be build at once, so it is important to prioritize what to build first and what will go on the roadmap later. This needs to be answered in a strategic manner that tie back to business goals and objectives.

### Why Product Management is Important

- Products became so complicated.
- Making sure that the products being built are the ones the people want.
- Aligning with all teams needed to build and launch the product.

## Product Manager role

- At its very core, the role of the PM is to make sure that the team is solving the right problems and building the right products.
- PMs take care of the product from an idea all the way through launch.
- Due to limited resources, they prioritize their roadmap. This often involves weighing several different tradeoffs.
- There is a misconception that PM in a position to take all the decisions, while the truth is that PM doesn't have a direct authority over other teams. However, he needs to influence, cooperate, drive the team to alignment on what the product should do and what should be built.
- Identify the problem, study its impact and the amount of effort to solve it. Solving the problem can lead to:
	- Make product more appealing.
	- Increase sales.
	- Reduce churn.
	- Keep you competitive.
	- Increase your team efficiency.
	- Be required for legal compliance.
- Be SPOC of their product. He should be able to answer any question related to their product or guide where to find the answer.
- Since PMs don't have direct authority, they need to persuade, convince, and secure buy-in from a variety of cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- They are responsible for coordinating the development of a product across all relevant parties like design, business, engineering, marketing, and support teams.
- They need to make sure that the entire team is on the same page through presentations or conversations.
- PMs write PRDs to frame the problem and document requirements for the solution.

### Startup vs Enterprise

- The role of the PM can vary a lot based on the company size.
- At smaller companies, where it has broader focus, less support, and less process, it's more likely that PMs will have more end to end responsibility and wear more hats.
- Whereas at larger companies oftentimes there will be larger supporting teams, which allow PMs to maintain a narrow focus and go super deep on that specific area.

### Building philosophies

#### Product-Driven

- Focus on solving problems for users.
- The PM role is to identify and write the requirements and then hand them off to engineers.
- The engineers build based on these requirements
- Pros:
	- Customer centric approach
	- Build what customer want
- Cons:
	- Lack empathy from non-customer-facing teams
- Example:
	- Amazon same day shipping

#### Engineering-Driven

- Focus on solving technical problems.
- Engineers build things and then hand them off to the PM.
- The PM role is to figure out the technology and bring it to the market.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer
- Example:
	- Google Glass

#### Hybrid-Driven

- PMs write the requirements, but the engineers are included in identifying the requirements. Engineers build based on the requirements, but PMs are included in engineering design.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer

### Types of Product User

#### Consumer (B2C)

- Focus on user problems.
- Provides value for the user.
- User purchases the product.
- Faster pace of iteration.

#### Enterprise (B2B)

- Focus on business and user problems.
- Provides most value to the company and some value to the user.
- Business is the customer who purchases the product.
- Generally slower iteration.

### Types of products

#### Software

- PM focus on digital experience like apps and websites.
- PM need to understand roll-out cycles and process like App Store review.

#### Hardware

- PM focus on components, capabilities, cost, and supply chain.
- PM need to understand the build timelines, factory line setup, shipping certification and import implications.
- Physical products once built, it cannot be updated easily.

#### Data

- PM focus on building and power products, potentially through ML.
- PM need to understand data and numbers, to build products on top of data like Netflix recommendations and self-driving cars.

#### Growth

- PM focus on getting new users by growing the product through features that drive adoption, either directly or indirectly.
- PM need to understand funnel optimization, acquisition, and onboarding strategies.

#### Internationalization

- PM focus on brining the product to new places.
- PM need to understand the differences in those markets, differences in user behavior, and expectations and adopting the product to fit. Like adding feature to support RTL writing.

## Product phases

- Knowing that multiple products can be worked on at the same time at different phases

### Identifying problems and requirements

#### Identifying Opportunities

- Although there are many problems, PM needs to identify which problem that deserves the effort. Choosing the right problem can be critical in the product success.
- It is not possible to fix every problem being faced, not all problems have the same impact.
- There are several ways to figure out which problem to solve:
	- **Research**: to leverage insights and data to create hypotheses and test them.
		- Stakeholder interviews:
			- Helps to get a better understanding of the business objectives and requirements.
		- Market: 
			- To understand the current space.
			- Know the products and related products in the field.
			- Understand how the competition is.
			- Aware with the trends.
		- User: 
			- To understand the user customs and cultures.
			- Do interviews to receive feedback
			- Deepen the understanding of the user and his needs.
	- **Existing product data**:
		- To understand whether the product is being used.
		- Analyze the reasons that the users might not be using the product for.
		- Figure out ideas or features that can improve the product adoption.
	- **Support team data**:
		- To have an understanding of the common issues that the users face.
		- Detect trends in complaints
		- Be able to prioritize the issues that require fixing. That can help in reducing the cost of providing support.
	- **Efficiency gains**:
		- Something that results in a process being less expensive to complete (shorter amount of time, less money, etc).
		- For ex: Automate tedious tasks whenever possible to free up more bandwidth in their capacity.
		- This will provide space for scalability and value over time
	- **Tie with Business goals**:
		- Fixing the problem should meet with the business goals.
		- Business goals can be:
			- Increase Revenue
			- Add new users
			- Improve engagement
			- Reduce Costs
			- Reduce Churn
- It is possible to change the product, choose a different problem, or even shuffle the team, but it is not possible to control the market

#### Understanding the market

- It is very important to understand the market, identify which market is better and create a product that satisfies this market.
- Product/Market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.
- Market can be measured with:
	- **Size**: As the need is higher, the easier to monetize the product.
	- **Growth**: Does this demand is expected to be increasing.
	- **Acquisition**: How easy to acquire new users?
- Gain a better understanding of the market by:
	- Online research
	- Headlines & News
	- Similar products
	- Trends
		- [Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends](https://www.bondcap.com)
		- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com)
	- Talk to users and customers
- Evaluate [Product/Market Fit](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit-2/):
	- No Product/Market Fit:
		- Users aren't getting value
		- No word of mouth
		- No press buzz
		- Slow growth
	- Product/Market Fit:
		- Users get a lot of value.
		- Product practically sells itself.
		- Press is reaching out to talk to you about your product.
		- Product in high demand.

#### Finding a target user

- Target user is the user you are designing your product for and the user you expect to use it.
- A target user represents a group of users with shared characteristics.
- **Research**:
	- Review data including market research.
	-  Perform interviews.
	-  Conduct surveys.
	-  Run focus groups.
	-  Review existing customer data.
- **User Characteristics**: Once have data, look into their characteristics for trends:
	- Demographics
	-  Motivations
	-  Goals
	-  Frustrations
- **User Personas**
	- A user persona is a fictional person that you create who might use your product. 
	- Once identified trends across these characteristics, create user personas to represent them.
	- Creating a Persona:
		1.  Start by creating a name for your persona.
		2.  Include a photo, or illustration, of what this user might look like.
		3.  Add a quote with a key insight about this user.
		4.  Include a description of the user with details that are relevant to your product.
		5.  Outline the user's goals.
		6.  Describe what motivates the user.
	- Throughout the product development, it is needed to refer back to the personas, in order to stress test and challenge some of the ideas.

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

- TAM is a measure of the revenue opportunity for a product.
- TAM doesn’t predict the future sales. It’s an estimate of the potential size of the market.

##### Calculating TAM
- TAM = Average revenue per user (ARPU) X total number of potential users in the market
- There are several approaches to calculating TAM:
	- **Top Down**:
		- Start with a high level view of the economy, and then narrow that down based on factors like demographics.
		- For example, you will usually start with everyone in the world and narrow down that audience to people who are interested in your product.
		- Example: Water bottle company
			- 7.8 billion people on Earth
			- 330 million people in the US
			- 2 liters per day
			- $1 per liter
			- (330 million people) x (2 liters per day) x ($1 per liter) x (365 days per year)= $241B
	- **Bottoms Up**:
		- Use known data points that you have (data from early customers and sales) that you could extrapolate to represent a larger market opportunity.
		- For example, if you are already selling a product in one region and were considering selling it globally.
		- Example: Water bottle company
			- 330 million people in the US  
			- 25% of population buys one liter per day  
			- $1 per liter  
			- (330 million people) x (25% of people) x ($1 per liter) x (365 days per year)= $30.1B
	- **Value Theory**:
		- Used for new product categories where you don’t have much information to base estimates on.
		- This involves conducting market research to understand how much people would pay for your product and how many potential customers you have.
		- TAM = Price x People who would purchase

#### Return on Investment (ROI)

- It is a measure on how efficient to invest in a product.
- It helps to determine which problem worth solving.
- It is the ratio between the net profit and amount of investment.
- Projects with positive ROI will cover the investment required to build the product.
- A high ROI indicates more impact with less effort.
- Rule:
	- Generic $$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{amount gained} - \text{amount spent}}{\text{amount spent}}$$
	- For software products $$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{impact} - \text{cost of development time}}{\text{cost of development time}}$$
	- Key points:
		- `Amount gained`: can be increase in sales or decrease in costs.
		- `Cost of development time`: Can be measure by how many employees are involved and for how long.
- ROI calculations might require involvement of Finance or Data Science teams to avoid any wrong calculations.

#### Payback Period

- Payback period measures the amount of time that it takes for a product to recoup the initial investment required to build it.
 $$\text{Payback Period}=Cost/(\frac{Time}{Impact​})$$

#### Creating a hypothesis

- Hypotheses helps in making sure that the assumptions are correct, and that the product is solving a real problem for real people.
- After creating hypotheses, they need to be tested to make sure they are true in the real world.
- **Hypothesis types**:
	- Customer Need
		- What are the specific goals that the customers are trying to reach?
		- Is this a real problem?
		- Is there urgency for solving this problem?
		- Where is the opportunity to help them reach their goals?
		- Is the product a Painkiller, which provides an immediate relief? Or is it a vitamin, which is nice to have?
			- It’s important to understand the urgency of the problem.
	- The Solution:
		- Does the solution help the customers meet their needs?
		- What alternatives does the customer currently have or use to reach their goals?
		- Is this solution much better than other options?
	- Differentiation:
		- How does the product is different compared to other solutions?
		- Does it have an edge that customer will choose it upon others?
	- Value:
		- Does the solution provide ENOUGH value for users?
		- How much will people pay for it?
		- What can you do to increase willingness to pay?
			- It’s important to understand what aspects need to be present in your product to increase willingness to pay.
- **Hypothesis Evaluation**:
	- User interviews:
		- It can work better with a walkthrough of a prototype.
		- The results should have a decision regarding whether the solution will be used or will be considered for purchase.
		- This will give an understanding of how beneficial the solution for the users and how they are perceiving it.
	- Focus groups:
		- A small group of people you can present concepts to in order to see how they react. Generally this will be a diverse group of people and you will have specific questions you’d like to get their feedback on
		- It is different from one to one interviews because focus groups have interaction between the participants. 
		 - Participants build on top of each other's ideas or disagree and provide and alternative views.
		 - PMs should avoid group thinking in which only one idea surfaces within the group.
	 - Surveys:
		 - It is best used for high level questions.
		 - It is used to get feedback from many people.
		 - But it has limited in types of question and how deep the questions can go.
		 - It is better to cooperate with a researcher who can create correct type of questions with minimizing the bias.
	 - Design Sprint:
		 - It helps to stress test into how the problem is framed and further define a solution.
		 - The last step of sprint is to validate, where real users are involved to receive their feedback.
	 - The solution will not have a Product/Market fit, and should be rejected or tweaked if:
		 - It doesn't satisfy a customer need.
		 - It is not differentiated enough compared to other solutions.
		 - There is no willingness to pay.

#### Building a Business Case

- This approach might be required for brand-new products. While for smaller ones, a PRD can sufficient.
- It answers the question on why should the company invest in building this project.
- PM will be needed to justify on why the project worth building to the stakeholder and sponsors.
- Topics to be covered in a business case:
	- Business problem:
	- Benefits
	- Costs
	- Risks
	- Possible solutions
	- Timeline
	- Competition
- Business case should be organized into the following sections:
	- **Executive Summary** 
		- It summarizes the entire document, including the recommendation. 
		- You want to make sure that it has enough detail that if it’s the only thing people read they will understand the justifications for building the product.
		- It’s also the first thing people read and usually the last thing you will write to make sure that everything is cohesive.
	- **Problem Statement**:
		- It explains the problem you are trying to solve, as well as the associated goals.
		- It should also clearly link the problem back to the business strategy and goals.
	- **Analysis of Product Opportunity**:
		- It discusses the merits of why solving the problem is important. 
		- You’ll usually want to touch on the cost of the problem and the size of the opportunity.
		- Additionally, you can discuss what would happen if you didn’t solve the problem.
	- **Possible Solutions**:
		- It will describe the potential solutions to the problem. 
		- For each solution, you should discuss benefits, cost, timeline, and risks.
	- **Recommended Approach**: 
		- It puts forward your recommendation for which solution is the best and why.
- Other tips:
	-   Tailor it to your audience
	-   Shorter is better
	-   Make it interesting
	-   Demonstrate business value

### Creating Solutions

- Search for build strategies on how to solve the problem through creation of the product.
- The solution should be related with the company goals and KPIs.

### Timelines

- It is used to visualize tasks that need to be done to deliver the product. It presents task dependencies, resource allocations, workflows schedules, and deadlines.
- Timelines has a fixed start and end dates. It incorporates sprint cycles with the product's short time strategies.
- Assess the expected timelines according to the design and engineering teams feedback.
- If the product is large, it can be split into milestones. In which each milestone can be a standalone project and the following milestones will add more features into the project.
- Timelines components:
	1. Product Improvements
	2. Resources Management
	3. Risk Management
	4. Deadline

### [Roadmap][1]

- It identifies all the initiatives required for the creation and marketing of a product.
- It is mainly used to visualize product's strategy that is aligned with business goals.
- A roadmap streamlines business goals into strategic and executable paths.
- A roadmap can span across multiple timelines for continuous product development.
- A high-level roadmap explains the strategic course of action, with major milestones that you must complete to deliver your products on time.
- Roadmap components:
	1. Product Goal
	2. Strategic Objectives
	3. Major Features (Epics)
	4. Releases Plans
- Roadmap audiences are:
	- Senior management
	- External investors

### Product Requirement Document (PRD)

- PRD is the most important artifact in product cycle.
- It is the source of truth that answers all question related to:
	- What is being built?
	- Why is it needed?
	- Who is it being build for?
- It drives alignment between the team to reach the same final goal.
- PRD is never done, it is continuously updated as decisions are made and new information becomes available.
- PRD components:
	- Frame the problem
	- Outline the goals
	- Success Metrics
	- Describes the requirements
	- Assumptions
	- Out of scope
	- UI Mocks
	- Risks and Mitigations
	- Support Plan
- Priority Level needs to be mentioned, the below shorthand is common
	- P0: A launch blocking feature. The product will not launch without it
	- P1: A nice to have feature at launch, but not required. If not present at launch, it should be a fast follow
	- P2: A desirable feature
	- P3, P4: Unlikely to get built

### UX Design

- It is important to work closely with the product designer during wireframing.
- PM should provide context, requirements, visuals if possible, so the designer can take decisions. It is possible to provide design opinions and guidance, but it may not be always correct.
- Prototyping
	- Visualizing the UX can help in identifying gaps.
- Once the UX is ready, run usability testing to surface any issues. A/B testing can be better for small changes that usability testing will not fit.

### Implementation

- Make sure that engineering team fully understand the requirements.
- Cover and think of all possible edge cases.
- Get regular status updates to know whether the implementation is on track or the dates are slipping. This will surface any roadblocks that the team is running into so that you can help to remove them.

### Testing

- Review test plans with QA teams to outline which scenarios should be tested, the steps to be taken and the expected behavior.
- After QA team test the product, PM also should test it to find any bugs, and make sure that it meets the expected standards.

### Launch

- PM should work with the PR and marketing team to figure out how to launch the product.
- Launches can be silently or with big announcements by posting blog posts or held press conferences.
- For risks launches, it is advised to have a slow roll-out in phases. To have a chance to check the metrics and data.

### Review

- Check how the launch went. This can include different dimensions like changes in key metrics, users sentiments, or how the team thinks the launch went.
- Identify what can be learned and avoid any mistakes in future ones.

## Product Vision and Strategy

### Vision

- **Vision is**:
	- What your product looks like in its final state.
	- Essence of your product.
	- What your product does and why it matters to users.
	- Can be summarized in a sentence or two.
- **Vision needs to tell a story about**:
	- What you’re building.
	- Who it’s for.
	- Why it matters.
- **Vision should be**:
	 - Inspiring
	 - Ambitious
	 - Easy to explain
	 - Something the team believes in
	 - Something you evolve over time
	 - Something you share out frequently
- **Vision matters because**:
	- It gets the team excited and motivated about building the product. It should be something that pushes the team.
	- It serves as a north star for guiding the team and decision-making. It sets the direction of the product
- **Vision Examples**:
	- Google Wi-Fi: A wireless router that people love
	- Facebook: Connect with friends and the world around you
	- Amazon: Earth's most customer-centric company and a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online
	- [More examples](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/best-examples-of-a-vision-statement.html)
- _Vision will impact every single aspect of your product, so it is important to be thoughtful when you are crafting your vision._

- **Factors to consider**:
	- User needs
		- Who is the target user?
		- What are their needs?
	- Key features
		- What are the primary features that solve the user's need?
		- Will these features result in people using the product?

### Business Models

- A business model describes how a business creates, delivers, and captures value.
- **Business Model Canvas**
	- It captures a number of different components that will impact your ability to create and bring a product to market.
		- Things you need to build the product and their associated costs.
		- The value proposition for your product.
		- Getting your product to your customers and the associated revenue streams.
	- It is a really helpful tool to map out and understand all the components that you need to build a product and a successful business:
		- **Key Partners**: 
			- They help build or deliver the product to users. 
			- Examples:

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **KPIs**, or _Key Performance Indicators_, are metrics that measure the performance of your product against your strategy.
- They capture the big picture and help you to understand how well your product is working (or isn’t working) and are aligned with business objectives.
- **Types** of KPIs:
	- **Business KPIs**:
		- It measures how you are doing against business goals.
		- Examples:
			- Average Revenue per User (ARPU)
			- Conversion from free to paid subscription
			- Churn rate (how often do users stop using the product)
	- **Product KPIs**:
		- It measures how the product is being used.
		- Examples:
			- Weekly Active Users
			- Average number of calls per user per week
			- Average time between sign up and first use
	- **Quality** **KPIs**
		- It measures how often users encounter issues.
		- Examples:
			- Percent of calls delivered in high quality
			- Average user rating
			- Support contact rate (percent of users who need to contact support for help)
	- **Development KPIs**:
		- It measures how the team executes.
		- Examples:
			- On-time delivery of new features that are being developed
			- Outages per month
			- Average length of an outage
- **Tips** for picking KPIs:
	- Don’t measure everything
		- While every KPI is a metric, not every metric will be a KPI. KPIs are metrics that capture the performance of your product against your strategy.
		- You want to have a small, focused set of KPIs. This will allow the team to focus on moving those specific KPIs.
	- Align user, product, and business goals
	- Make sure KPIs are measurable
	- Use percentages and time periods when setting goals

### Negotiation

- **Negotiation** is all about trying to reach an agreement when there is **conflict**.
- As a PM, you will be negotiating **every day**, whether it’s about what the product should do, who’s going to be working on the product, or timelines.

#### Negotiation styles:

- **Competitive**
	- Me: Win
	- You: Lose
- **Collaborative**
	- Me: Win

	- You: Win
- In most cases a **Collaborative** style is the best approach

#### Strategies for Negotiation

- **BATNA** (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)
	- Understanding each side’s best alternative to a negotiated agreement will help you focus on what happens if you can’t reach an agreement -- and that can give you leverage to get to an agreement.
- **Focus on interests**
	- It’s helpful to understand what each side is interested in and why so understand where to focus during negotiation.
- **Make the pie bigger**
	- Based on understanding the other side’s interests, are there any things that you can offer that will be valuable for them that won’t cost you anything or be difficult for you to give away?
-  **Use objective criteria**
	- Using objective criteria bases the conversation in reality and helps remove emotion.
- **Present multiple solutions**
	- Multiple solutions help you get more information because you receive feedback about how the other side feels about each option.

#### Tips for negotiating:

-   Build strong relationships
-   Use active listening
-   Keep emotions in check
-   Work together to find a solution

## Design Sprint

### What is a Design Sprint

- **Design thinking** is a human centered, iterative approach to solve problems through deeply understanding users and needs, redefining problems, creating innovative solutions, and testing them.
- While **Design Sprint** is a design thinking based time constrained process to explore and reduce the risk of building new products or features.
	- Design Sprints are most often discussed in the context of product development but can also be applied to internal process improvement
- It is about how to bring an idea through concept, design, and user validation, as well as creating a spec to handoff to engineering.
- How to use Design Thinking to diverge in order to explore ideas and then ultimately focus in and converge on a single idea.
- Mapping out the full concept and creating a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.
- **Using a Design Sprint**:
	- Allows the team to explore and learn without actually building
	- Means the process can fail early without serious consequences
	- Creates buy-in and ownership among the team
- The Design Sprint process is highly customizable and can be adapted to the specifics of each challenge.

#### Design Sprint phases

1. Understand:
	- Create a shared understanding of the problem space, the user, the competition, and why it all matters. Align as a team on a focus moving forward for the rest of the sprint
2. Define:
	- Start by focusing on where you want to end. By setting goals you can work backwards to understand what needs to happen in order to get there.
3. Sketch
	- Ideate. Start diverging and exploring lots of different solutions.
4. Decide
	- Bring it all back together and decide on one idea to take through prototyping and validation
5. Prototype
	- Map out and build a prototype of your idea
6. Validate
	- Check to make sure that your idea is solving a real user need… and that it can be built!

- The first two phases are about understanding the problem. The next two phases are about coming up with a different solutions and then narrowing in and picking one. The last two phases are about building out and testing that one idea.
- Each two phases has a common pattern which starts with diverging and expanding to explore all aspects, and ends with converging and narrowing to focus on the specifics.
- Each phase has a set of tools that can be used to facilitate reaching the goal of each phase.
- However, it’s not necessary to use every tool for a given phase. Instead you should focus on picking the best tool for the problem you are trying to tackle and the composition of your sprint team.

#### Design Sprint Outcomes

- **At the end of the sprint**:
	- A working prototype for the concept
	- Insights and validation from users on your concept
	- Tons of artifacts
	- List of other ideas that can be explored
- **After the sprint**:
	- More testing and iteration
	- The concept will go to Design to be more fully fleshed out
	- The concept will go to Engineering to build
	- Make a case with leadership to invest more resources in bringing concept to market
	- The concept is abandoned because it doesn’t address a user need
- Before the sprint starts, it’s a good practice to plan what the next steps afterward will be. But it’s also important to acknowledge and respond appropriately based on the outcome of the sprint.

#### Design Sprint Participants

- The best Design Sprints occur when there’s good representation across a number of different functions.
	- Want around 6 members on the team
	- Members should bring different perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of expertise
	- Team typically includes someone from Product, Design, and Engineering - but there’s no hard and fast rule
	- Need to find the right people to bring perspective and focus to the current challenge.
- Different functions as:
	- Product
	- Design
	- Engineering
	- Data Science
	- Marketing
	- Support
	- Operations
	- Sales
	- Privacy
	- Legal
	- Leadership
	- Finance
	- and many more

#### Design Sprint fits when

- Design Sprints are best suited when there are big open questions.
- They don’t work as well when a solution or in depth direction has already been identified.
- Design Sprint is a good fit in:
	- New product
	- New feature for existing product
	- Improvement to existing product
	- You need to solve a complex problem
	- You don’t already have an answer
- Design Sprint is unlikely to be helpful:
	- There is already clear product direction, just not final designs
	- There is not enough foundational research to understand user needs
	- You already have an answer

#### Design Sprint Planning

##### Sprint Master

- Creates the structure of the Sprint
- Selects which methodologies will be used
- Facilitates during the sprint
- Keeps the team focused and on track

##### First Sprint

1.  Participate in a sprint to really get a better understanding of exactly how they work
2.  Shadow a Sprint Master as they are putting together and planning a Sprint
3.  Co-facilitate a sprint with another experienced Sprint Master

##### Challenge Statement

- Creating a challenge statement for a Design Sprint is a great way to help everyone understand the purpose of the sprint. The best challenge statements are:
	- Short and easy to understand
	- Something with urgency that needs to be delivered
	- Contain a timeframe
	- Are inspiring and get people excited
- Challenge statement formula:
	- **[ACTION] + [OUTPUT] + FOR [USER] + TO [PROBLEM] + BY [TIMEFRAME]**
- Challenge statement example:
	- **Design an app for consumers to make it easier to purchase items by next year**

##### Sprint Team

- About 6 people
	- If more than that, split the group into smaller teams that work through exercises in parallel and then share with the whole group
- You will want to identify people whose work is directly related to the sprint challenge

##### Agenda

- Build a rough agenda for your sprint.
- Select methods for each phase that will provide insights for the problem you are trying to solve.
- Keep in mind the composition of your sprint team
	- If people are more familiar with the problem space, it likely will make more sense to spend more time on ideation 
	- Whereas if people are less familiar it would make sense to spend more time on understanding the problem space.

##### Space

- Secure a space for the sprint to take place, preferably somewhere away from distractions
- Tons of space for everyone who is participating
- Whiteboards or lots of wall space for posting stickies

##### Supplies

- Post it notes
- Dry erase markers for whiteboard (multiple colors)
- Sharpies
- Pens
- Paper
- Giant post it notes (if no whiteboard)

##### Logistics

- Send a calendar invite to the sprint team
- Coordinate getting some light snacks / refreshments for each day
- Arrive earlier to make sure that the room is arranged in a way that is conducive for collaboration (ex: a U shape around a whiteboard)
- Send a reminder the day before, with any pre-work that the team needs to do (like reviewing user research or trying competing products)

#### Design Sprint Icebreakers

- If your Sprint team hasn’t worked together before, it’s a good idea to spend a little bit of time getting the group comfortable with each other. At a minimum, this means that each member should know every other member’s name and role.
- It can also be beneficial to do a quick icebreaker exercise, although you won’t want to spend too much time on this -- no more than 20 minutes. These are short exercises designed to get people to open up and connect with others. Two quick icebreakers you can use are:
	- **Two truths and a lie** - each team member introduces themselves and includes three facts about themselves. Two of them are true and one is false. The team must figure out which one is false.
	- **Superpower** - each team member introduces themselves along with the superpower that they are bringing to the team

##### Further Readings

- [45 Ideas for Ice Breakers](https://www.sessionlab.com/blog/icebreaker-games/)

#### Working with Designers

- Product Managers and Designers both care a lot about the user.
- PMs are not a designer. Acknowledge that designers have expertise when talking about UI and flows.
	- When critiquing a design it’s often more effective to ask about the _**intention**_ of a choice
- There is a lot of overlap between the two roles when it comes to understanding and advocating for the user. **Both roles** are involved with researching user needs and defining use cases.
	- Deeply understands users and define use cases
	- Participates in and conducts User Research and Usability testing
- **Product managers** are responsible for the overall success (or failure) of a product and need to take input and communicate across a number of stakeholders.
	- Sets priorities for the team
	- Responsible for business outcomes
	- Manages stakeholders and communicates across larger team
- **Designers** go much more in depth with how the user should interact with and experience the product from a visual and interaction design perspective.
	- Owns visual and interaction design
	- Owns information architecture
	- Creates mocks and prototypes

### Phases of a Design Sprint

#### 1. Understand

- The goal with this phase is to create a shared understanding of the problem space across all sprint team members.
- There are a number of different ways that this understanding can be captured and shared.
- You’ll want to set up inputs that highlight and demonstrate different viewpoints and perspectives across a multitude of dimensions.
- This can be achieved by various techniques:

##### Techniques to capture inputs

###### Lighting Talks

- **Lightning talks**: A lightning talk is a short presentation, usually about 20 minutes, focused on a specific topic.
- **User research**
	- Ask:
		- Who is the user?
		- What are their needs and goals?
		- Why does this problem matter to users?
	- Examples:
		- Researcher presents study on users with purchase intent
		- Researcher presents from study on users with [X] need
- **Business goals/needs**
	- Ask:
		- What are we trying to solve?
		- Why does it matter?
		- What have we tried in the past?
		- What’s worked well and not so well?
	- Examples:
		- Sales team presents industry trends and competitive landscape
		- CEO presents importance of specific market/region
- **Technology**
	- Ask:
		- What are our technical capabilities?
		- What are the limits and constraints or limitations on our existing tech?
	- Examples:
			- Engineer presents new capabilities that are available
			- Engineer presents tear down of competitor tech

###### Interviews

- **Interviews**: Interviews allow you to gain perspectives from a number of different vantage points.
- **User interviews**
	- To:
		- Build empathy for users
		- Get a deeper understanding of user needs and pain points.
	- With:
		- Users who have your product
		- Users who have a competing product
		- Users who might be interested in your product
- **Stakeholder interviews**
	- To:
		- Dive deeper into some of the reasoning, rationale, and context of why this specific problem is important to solve.
		- Topics can include any previous efforts to solve this or a similar problem
	- With:
		- Operations team
		- Sales team
		- Legal team
- **Expert interviews**
	- To:
		- Provide specialized insights around a specific problem, population, or technology.
		- Can be either internal or external
	- With:
		- An expert in the domain of your project

###### Competitive Analysis

- **Competitive analysis**: Get a better understanding of the competition and other solutions that exist in the problem space
- Doing research, including checking out websites and press materials
- Reading reviews
- Using the product and recording your experience.
- But, _Just because a competitor built something a certain way doesn’t mean it was the right thing to build or that it was built the right way._

##### Methods to capture inputs

###### How Might We

- A method to capture problems and frame them as opportunities that can be solved.
	- Each statement should be captured on its own sticky note.
	- Statements should focus on open ended opportunities, rather than a specific solution.
	- Try to avoid statements that are too narrow.
- “How Might We” statements always start with the same three words, which creates a positive solution oriented framing.
	- **How** - acknowledges that we don’t know the answer yet but believe this problem can be solved.
	- **Might** - acknowledges there can be more than one solution and that we shouldn’t stop at the first idea. “Might” also acknowledges that not every solution will work, but it’s still ok to discuss and explore ideas that might not pan out
	- **We** - acknowledges that the team is invested in solving this problem together.
- **Examples**:
	- *"Make it easier for people to find items"*. **Bad** example because it should be framed as a question. Instead, *"How might we make it easier for people to find items?"*
	- *"How might we use couriers to deliver groceries to people's homes?"*. **Bad** example because it should support multiple solutions. Instead, *"How might we get groceries to people faster?"*
	- *"How might we build an app for our store?"*. **Bad** example because it should not be too broad. Instead, *"How might we let customers place orders online?"*

###### Rose Bud Thorn: 
- A method to visually classify aspects of a topic as being positive, an opportunity, or negative.
- "Rose Bud Thorn":
	- **Roses** are positive things. For example roses could be things that are going well or seen as a successful. Roses can also represent things or parts of a product that people enjoy.
	- **Buds** are things that could turn into roses, if given the right attention. They represent areas of opportunity.
	- **Thorns** are negative things. For example thorns could be problems or shortcomings. They also can represent broken product experiences.
- Write One thing per sticky.
- Use different colored stickies for roses, buds and thorns.

###### Affinity Mapping

- A method to visually sort related ideas together into categories and themes.
- **Steps**:
	- Quickly discuss idea/insight.
	- Place it on the board next to similar or related ideas
	- Over time **clusters** of related sticky notes have started to form.
	- Label each cluster.
	- After placing all notes, check for clusters related to each other.
	- Rearrange related clusters to be next to each other to create **themes**.
	- Circle related clusters and label each theme.
- **Things to Remember**
	- It’s an interactive process. Make sure to leverage the group
	- Make sure to have an “Other” category. This is helpful if an idea doesn’t fit with other sticky notes. No need to try and force everything to fit into a category.
	- Don’t be afraid to move things around. The first categories you come up with probably won’t be your final categories.
	- Make sure to take photos, especially at the end with the completed affinity map.

#### 2. Define

- It is the second phase of the Design sprint.
- The goal of this phase is to create focus on what to achieve and how define success. Once you’ve identified that vision, it becomes much easier to understand and frame all the other steps you will need to take to realize that vision.

##### Success Metrics

- Success Metric is a way to measure whether or not your project achieved its goals
- The **HEART** framework, which was created at Google, is a user-centered method to define metrics that measure the quality of the user experience or to measure quality of user experience at scale. It’s simple and easy to understand and can help with decision making in later phases.
- There are five dimensions:
	- **Happiness** - user attitude towards your product.
	- **Engagement** - how users are using the product in terms of frequency or number/types of features used.
	- **Adoption** - how many new users start using your product. Marketing can be a strong factor, but the belief is that in long-term, the better the product is, the easier for new users to adopt it.
	- **Retention** - how many users keep coming back.
	- **Task Success** - ability for users to complete critical tasks in order to be successful with the product.
- Across these dimensions, you will then want to start by identifying goals, then signals, and finally metrics to measure how well your product is doing.
	- A **goal** is something the user is trying to do or something you are trying to help them to do
	- A **signal** is a change in user behavior that indicates that the user is achieving the goal
	- A **metric** is a way to measure signal and quantify how much user behavior has changed
- **Examples**:
	- Happiness:
		- Goal: Efficient pick up
		- Signal: Waiting for pick up
		- Metric: Avg. wait time
	- Engagement:
		- Goal: Buy products
		- Signal: Product added to cart
		- Metric: Avg # products purchased per cart
	- Adoption:
		- Goal: Share with friends
		- Signal: Refer a friend
		- Metric: Referral sign up rate
	- Retention:
		- Goal: Automatic ordering of basics
		- Signal: Opt in to auto orders
		- Metric: Avg # of auto ordered items / user / month % of users with auto order
	- Task success:
		- Goal: Find item easier later
		- Signal: Item added to shopping list
		- Metric: % of users with items on list
- **Things to remember**:
	- Success metrics are important because they allow you to quantify how successful your project is.
	- By identifying your success metrics upfront, it sets a clear target for the team to understand what is considered success.
- **Further Readings**:

##### Design Principles

- Design principle is a framework that guides the way that you think about building your product or it guides the development of your concept.
- Agreeing on design principles with the team can make decisions and reviews easier later because you can refer to the already agreed-upon principles.
- **A design principle**:
	- Focuses on what matters most
	- Describes the personality of your product.
	- Expressed by a short phrase followed by a brief explanation with a few more details
- When executed well, design principles can be easily identified by people who use the product.
- **Examples**:
	- **Google**: fast with a-less-is-more approach to create a UI focused on getting to your answer as quickly as possible.
	- **Airbnb:** connecting hosts and guests globally around the world like a mutual friend would
	- **Apple:** trustworthy because it takes care to keep your private data private.
- **Creating Design Principles**
	1. Ask the team to spend 5-10 minutes individually brainstorming design principles that they think will be important for the project.
	2. Bring the team together and have each team members share their ideas.
	- You can use affinity mapping to find common themes just like we did for the "how might we" statements.
- **Things to remember**:
	- Design principles are guidelines that should craft how you think about building your product. By aligning on design principles with your team, it also makes decision making easier because you can frame questions in the context of your design principles.
	- When you are writing design principles with your team, you should capture each principle with a word or two and a short explanation that explains the intent in more detail. When you refer to your design principles later you can just refer to the short version.
- **Further Readings**:
	- [Spotify's Design Principles](https://spotify.design/article/introducing-spotifys-new-design-principles)
	- [Design Principles](https://principles.design/)

##### Future Press Release

- It is a great way to get everyone on the team aligned on the outcomes you are trying to achieve.
- **Its Components**:
	- Name of the product (although this doesn’t have to be final and can change)
	- Who is the target user?
	- What problem does your product solve?
	- How does your product solve this problem?
	- Why your team built this
	- Why should users care?
	- How do users react to your product?
	- What sets this product apart from others?
	- How can users get the product
- **Things to remember**:
	- Write this for an external audience that is not familiar with the product space
	- Don't use acronyms.
	- Incorporate quotes into the press review either from people on the team or made up users.
	- Keep a positive, excited tone.
	- When talking about the solution focus on _**what**_ the product does rather than _**how**_ it does it.
		- **Examples**:
			- **WHAT**: Takes amazingly clear pictures at night
			- **HOW**: Captures several images on shutter press with varying exposure lengths and processes images through a machine-learning algorithm to compose rich, detailed images in low light conditions

#### 3. Sketch

- It is the third phase in Design Sprint
- The goal of this phase is to create and explore lots of ideas and then start narrowing them down to a few. Those ideas will be explored in more depth through more detailed sketching.
- It leverage the shared understanding in phase 1 and the outcomes defined in phase 2 as a jumping off point for the sketches.

##### Sketching Tips

- Don't focus on quality. Sketches aren't supposed to look super realistic.
- Have the right tools:
	- Thick-line marker
	- Thin-line marker
	- Highlighters in multiple colors
	- Dotted paper ([Dotted Grid Paper Generator](https://mathpolate.com/grid-maker-tools/grid-maker))
- Start with the outline and iterate over to continue to add detail.
- Use placeholder for UI elements:
	- Box with simple outline = image
	- Box with play icon = video
	- Think line = header
	- Thin line = copy
	- Rectangle = button
- Label the buttons and headers
- Use color to highlight important things but don't overdo it or it'll be difficult to interpret the sketch.
- Add annotations to describe what's going on.

##### Crazy 8's technique

- It is a sketching activity that will quickly generate a lot of ideas in 8 minutes.
	- 8 sketches in 8 minutes
	- 1 sketch per minute
	- Quantity over quality (of sketching & idea)
	- Every sketch should be different
- Instructions:
	- Give each sprint team member a piece of paper and a pen
	- Fold the paper into eight sections so the team member can use each section for one sketch.
	- Set a timer on repeat for one minute. When the times goes off, it's time to move on to the next sketch.
	- After eight minutes, ask the team to share and vote on the best idea.
- Benefits:
	- Crazy 8s forces each team member to think beyond the first idea or two.
	- The obvious ideas will come to mind first and then it'll be more challenging to come up with the remaining ideas.
	- At the end of the exercise, the team will have a whole range of ideas, including some less obvious and really innovative ideas.

##### Voting

- After sketching exercise, let each member briefly explain his ideas.
- Share with each member 2 to 3 dot stickers or any convention for rating
- Ask each member to rate his most favorite sketch across all team sketches.
- In such that, a member with 3 dots can vote 3 sketches (1 vote each), 2 sketches (1 vote and 2 votes), or 1 sketch (3 votes)

##### Solution Sketching

- It is a high quality sketch that illustrates how a user interacts with the product to achieve their goal.
- Each sprint member should pick one idea, belongs to any member, and sketch it out in more detail.
- The solution sketch should contain at least 3 frames that show progression through different states.

- [How to Run a Crazy Eights Workshop](https://blog.prototypr.io/how-to-run-a-crazy-eights-workshop-60d0a67b29a)

#### 4. Decide

- It is the forth phase in Design Sprint.
- The goal of this phase is to converge on a single idea to carry forward for the remainder of the sprint all the way through prototyping and user validation.
- There are multiple decision making methods that can be used to get consensus on one idea, with a focus on making sure that the idea solves a real need for real users.
- It might be challenging because people might be attached to their own ideas, so it is important to evaluate the ideas using the same subjective criteria, like impact, timing, and feasibility when considering different ideas.
- Decision Making methods:

##### Assumptions and Questions

- It is used to normalize the way of thinking after being caught in train of thoughts, especially after Sketching phase.
- **Instructions**:
	- Go through each sketch and take a few moments to list out assumptions as a group, then create questions using those assumptions. To force considering other possibilities that wasn't considered.
- **Examples**:
	- "Does phones must have buttons?"
	- "Does shoes must have laces?"
	- "Does a software must have a save button?"
- **Further Readings**:

	- [Assumption Busting](http://creatingminds.org/tools/assumption_busting.htm)

##### Decision Matrix

- A decision matrix allows you to visualize the trade offs between different ideas when comparing across two criteria, like Effort needed for implementation, and its Value to the user.
	- Ideas generally worth pursuing will be high value & low effort or high value & high effort.
		- However, low effort and high value should be pursued only if the resources are tight because low effort ideas can also be duplicated by others quickly.
	- Ideas that are low value & high effort are generally not worth pursuing unless value increases or effort decreases in the future.
	- Ideas that may not make sense to pursue now, may be worth pursuing later if the value of the idea increase or the effort to pursue the idea decreases.
- **Further Readings**:
	- [Decision Matrix](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase4-decide/decision-matrix)

##### Six Thinking Hats

- It is a method to ensure that different perspectives are being discussed.
- The Thinking Hats exercise allows you to make sure that different perspectives are being discussed and pushes people to be open to different perspectives since everyone will have to represent multiple, differing views.
- The team discussion focuses on one hat at a time. The order can vary, but you'll want to start and end with the blue hat (process). This order works well when comparing ideas:
	- **Blue hat** - process (align on goals and order of hats):
		- Structure the conversation.
		- Align on what will be talked about
		- Ex: "generate at least 10 new feature ideas."
	- **White hat** - data
		- Share facts and info
		- Or ask questions to find facts.
			- What do we know?
			- What do we need to find out?
	- **Yellow hat** - benefits
		- Share the logical reasons on why a specific idea could be useful
	- **Black hat** - judgment
		- Focus on challenges of specific ideas
		- Discuss what could go wrong
	- **Green hat** - creativity
		- Discuss new view, alternative solutions, or ways that can de-risk and overcome challenges.
	- **Red hat** - intuition
		- No reasoning while wearing
		- Just guessing and hunching
	- **(again) Blue hat** - process (summary of discussion)
		- To summarize the discussion

	- [Six Hats of Critical Thinking](https://www.designorate.com/the-six-hats-of-critical-thinking-and-how-to-use-them/)

#### 5. Prototype

- Prototyping is a fast and cheap way to test and validate an idea.
- The prototype doesn’t have to capture the full product end to end, but should definitely focus on the core questions about the idea that you need to answer.

##### Storyboard

- Storyboard maps out the problem facing your user and the journey they go through with your product to solve it.
- A storyboard is composed of frames that depict events along the user journey.
- Each frame should have a caption that explains what is happening and why.
- The first frame should explain how the user found themselves in this scenario and what is the problem they are trying to solve.
- The storyboard will become the blueprint for the prototype.
- **Things to remember**:
	- Write your script first, and then create images for each frame.
	- The first frame should articulate the problem.
	- The last frame should show how your product helped the user solve the problem.
	- The frames in between the first and last frame should show how the user gets from the problem to the solution.

- **Further Readings**:
	- [The Role Of Storyboarding In UX Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/)

##### Prototyping

- A model of the most critical features of a product.
- **Best practices**:
	- Stay focused. Identify the screens/flows that you need to build in order to test your idea
	- Use a template. Build a base screen that you can duplicate to use as the foundation for additional screen
	- Keep it real. Avoid using placeholder assets and copy. This will change the way that users interact with and provide feedback about your prototype. **It doesn’t have to be perfect, but it does need to feel realistic.**
	- Test it. Click through your prototype once your done to make sure everything is working
- **Methods**:
	- **Video**:
		- High effort
		- Pros
			- Shows end to end user journey
			- Can generate a lot of excitement
			- Can communicate a lot
			- More tangible
		- Cons:
			- Time consuming and expensive
			- High level
			- Too much excitement
		- Best for storytelling
		- A video prototype is best suited for understanding if a concept is valid, with less focus on the exact implementation
	- **Paper**:
		- Low effort
		- Pros
			- Fast, cheap, and easy to iterate.
			- Great as a team building exercise since everyone can be involved
			- Automatic documentation
		- Cons
			- Won’t resemble a digital product
			- Can sometimes be difficult for participants to imagine it as if it were a digital software experience.
	- **Presentation Software**:
		- Medium effort
		- Pros:
			- Relatively easy to build and gets pretty close to mimicking what the real experience could feel like.
			- Easy to iterate
		- Cons:
			- Need to pay lots of attention around alignment, lots of importing mocks and checking alignment.
			- Doesn't always feel real.
	- **High Fidelity prototypes**:
		- Medium Effort
		- Pros:
			- Super realistic,
			- Great for identifying usability issues
			- Quick iteration
			- Can be used as a spec to the engineers.
		- Cons:
			- A little more work upfront
			- Doesn’t reflect what will actually be built (ie: latency)
		- Best for usability and realism

#### 6. Validate

- It is the sixth and final phase in Design Sprint.
- Its goal is to validate the idea and get feedback from target users without investing in a fully built product.
- It also validates that the idea can be build by the engineering team in a reasonable amount of time.
- Exposing the user to a concept or a prototype is very helpful to gain valuable feedback about whether the idea will satisfy a need or it will be used. Also, it will provide info about the porotype usability. UX researcher (Someone who studies the behavior of users) can help to coordinate a lot of this.

##### Planning a User Study

- Start with broader questions and background.
	- Who is your target user?
		- Existing users, new users or users of competitor's product?
		- Demographics or other characteristics related to the concept.
		- Age
		- Device type
		- Income
		- Gender
	- How many interviews will you have?
		- Typically 5-7
		- Minimum of 3
	- What do you want to find out?
		- Background information about the user
		- Specific questions around your idea
		- Tasks to complete with a prototype
	- How much time you will need to complete each interview. It is to set expectation for the participants and respect their time.
		- It can range from 45 to 60 mins per interview.
		- Shorter if it is just for testing a part of a product.
		- Longer if more in depth is required.
			- Can be multiple sessions if it is more than 90 mins.
- Specify feedback on idea and task completion
- Outline high level objectives, then add more detail and create an interview script that will guide the user through answering the questions you care about.
	- Does the product solve a real need?
	- What do users think of it? How it fits into their lives?
	- Can users navigate through the app?
		- It can be validated by asking the user to complete some tasks with the prototype.
- **Further Readings**:
	- [The Basics of Recruiting Users for Usability Testing](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-basics-of-recruiting-users-for-usability-testing)

##### User Interviews

- **Instructions**:
	- Introduce yourself and give an overview of what you will be asking the user to do during the study
	- Ask user to sign NDA (if applicable)
		- NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): A confidentiality agreement that prevents someone from disclosing specific information they were given access to, for example an upcoming product roadmap or feature set	
	- Ask if it is okay to record.
		- Assure them that the recording will be used only by the internal team and won't be used for marketing material.
	- Learn more about the user’s background by asking general questions (although the questions should be related to your project)
	- Start focusing in by shifting to more specific questions directly tied to your project space
	- Ask the user to complete tasks using the prototype.
		- Explain that it is not a test, it will only be need to understand their feedback
		- Ask for the possibility to think out loud so you can understand what is their understanding as they navigate the prototype.
	- Ask the user for their overall feedback about the prototype
	- Thank the user!
- **Things to remember**:
	- Keep questions open ended
	- If asked a question, try to get the user to answer the question from their perspective by reframing (ex: how do you think it should work?)
- **Further Readings**:
	- [How to conduct user interviews](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-conduct-user-interviews-fe4b8c34b0b7)
	- [6 Tips for Better User Interviews](https://uxplanet.org/6-tips-for-better-user-interviews-ad925afc52df)

##### Technical Feasibility

- If the idea cannot be built in a reasonable amount of time, it won't matter how good it is.
- It is important to involve the engineering early on to provide feedback regarding what is and what is not feasible or how complex it is. They might also provide better ideas with a simpler solution.
- Prototypes can facilitate the conversation by walking through user facing flows.
- You should also come prepared with some questions around what data is needed to generate the UI, where user entered data will be stored, and any causes for latency.
- **Examples** for interacting with an engineer:
	- **Not Helpful**: "We need to build this feature. It should be pretty simple to build."
	- **Helpful**: "Here is a PRD for a feature we have been thinking about. I wanted to get your thoughts on how difficult it would be to build."
	- **Best**: "Let me show you a mock for a feature we have been thinking about. It is pretty exciting because we think it will have a 20% lift on revenue. I would love to get your perspective on this feature and what challenges we might run into if we build it."
- **Further Readings**:
	- [Development fundamentals for UX designers](https://uxdesign.cc/development-fundamentals-for-ux-designers-caf759724874)

#### Next Steps

##### Iterate

- Iteration is going through the process again in order to make improvements
- It is an important part of the process that allows you to test and refine your ideas.
- It can reduce overall risk for a project by getting feedback early on without having to build out the actual product.
- Iteration does take time though. And you will never get everything completely perfect.
- It’s important to focus on getting the things right that will be hard to fix if you reach the wrong conclusion.

	- [Iterative User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/iterative-design/)

##### Evangelizing

- Evangelize is to get people excited and bought into the project.
- Sharing a summary of the Design Sprint more broadly will help to create buy into the project and the Design Sprint process.
- The most powerful artifact you can share will likely be the prototype since it will clear communicate your idea from the perspective of how a user would interact with it.
- **Further Readings**:
	- [The Art of Evangelism](https://hbr.org/2015/05/the-art-of-evangelism)

##### PRD Handoff

- After the sprint, it will be required to hand off the requirements to the other teams to start implementation. This where PRD comes in.
- PRD (Product Requirements Doc) that specifies why we’re building a product, how the product will work, and how the product’s success will be measured.
- A PRD typically has the following sections:
	- **Background**:
		- Framing the problem
		- Explains why it matters
		- Why this is something that should be solved
		- Will be similar to the most of the discussion in Phase 1
	- **Problem**:
		- A clear description of the problem needed to be solved.
	- **Goals**:
		- Identify objectives that the product will hopefully solve.
	- **Success metrics**:
		- To determine whether the product is considered successful.
	- **Features**:
		- It is the most important section
		- It lists all the features and their requirements priority.
		- For each feature, you'll want to include a priority level:
			- P0 = launch blocker. Product will not launch without this feature
			- P1 = desirable for launch, but not required. Fast follow after launch
			- P2 = nice to have
			- P3, P4 = unlikely to get built
