# Product Management Nanodegree by Udacity

## Introduction to Product Management

### What is a product manager

- Product Managers must:
	- Have deep understanding of the problem
	- Understand user needs
	- Know their product
	- Know the competition
- Product Managers spend a lot of their time:
	- Identifying/defining problems
	- Creating a strategy
	- Communicating All the time
- Coordinating development and launch
	- Responding to fires
		- PMs need to be able to juggle multiple tasks and quickly switch focus when priorities change, (i.e. there is an outage).
- Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:
	 - What are we building?
	 - Who are we building this for?
	 - Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
	 - When are we building this?
- Product Managers should be:
	 - Strategic
	 - Hyper aware of their user needs
	 - Intuitive regarding their users' response towards new features or changes in the product.
	 - Capable of getting the product to its full potential and vision while in building process.
	 - Source of truth for the current product state.
	 - Able to easily translate between different audiences, while communicating product details.
- Everything will not be build at once, so it is important to prioritize what to build first and what will go on the roadmap later. This needs to be answered in a strategic manner that tie back to business goals and objectives.

### Why Product Management is Important

- Products became so complicated.
- Making sure that the products being built are the ones the people want.
- Aligning with all teams needed to build and launch the product.

## Product Manager role

- At its very core, the role of the PM is to make sure that the team is solving the right problems and building the right products.
- PMs take care of the product from an idea all the way through launch.
- Due to limited resources, they prioritize their roadmap. This often involves weighing several different tradeoffs.
- There is a misconception that PM in a position to take all the decisions, while the truth is that PM doesn't have a direct authority over other teams. However, he needs to influence, cooperate, drive the team to alignment on what the product should do and what should be built.
- Identify the problem, study its impact and the amount of effort to solve it. Solving the problem can lead to:
	- Make product more appealing.
	- Increase sales.
	- Reduce churn.
	- Keep you competitive.
	- Increase your team efficiency.
	- Be required for legal compliance.
- Be SPOC of their product. He should be able to answer any question related to their product or guide where to find the answer.
- Since PMs don't have direct authority, they need to persuade, convince, and secure buy-in from a variety of cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- They are responsible for coordinating the development of a product across all relevant parties like design, business, engineering, marketing, and support teams.
- They need to make sure that the entire team is on the same page through presentations or conversations.
- PMs write PRDs to frame the problem and document requirements for the solution.

### Startup vs Enterprise

- The role of the PM can vary a lot based on the company size.
- At smaller companies, where it has broader focus, less support, and less process, it's more likely that PMs will have more end to end responsibility and wear more hats.
- Whereas at larger companies oftentimes there will be larger supporting teams, which allow PMs to maintain a narrow focus and go super deep on that specific area.

### Building philosophies

#### Product-Driven

- Focus on solving problems for users.
- The PM role is to identify and write the requirements and then hand them off to engineers.
- The engineers build based on these requirements
- Pros:
	- Customer centric approach
	- Build what customer want
- Cons:
	- Lack empathy from non-customer-facing teams
- Example:
	- Amazon same day shipping

#### Engineering-Driven

- Focus on solving technical problems.
- Engineers build things and then hand them off to the PM.
- The PM role is to figure out the technology and bring it to the market.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer
- Example:
	- Google Glass

#### Hybrid-Driven

- PMs write the requirements, but the engineers are included in identifying the requirements. Engineers build based on the requirements, but PMs are included in engineering design.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer

### Types of Product User

#### Consumer (B2C)

- Focus on user problems.
- Provides value for the user.
- User purchases the product.
- Faster pace of iteration.

#### Enterprise (B2B)

- Focus on business and user problems.
- Provides most value to the company and some value to the user.
- Business is the customer who purchases the product.
- Generally slower iteration.

### Types of products

#### Software

- PM focus on digital experience like apps and websites.
- PM need to understand roll-out cycles and process like App Store review.

#### Hardware

- PM focus on components, capabilities, cost, and supply chain.
- PM need to understand the build timelines, factory line setup, shipping certification and import implications.
- Physical products once built, it cannot be updated easily.

#### Data

- PM focus on building and power products, potentially through ML.
- PM need to understand data and numbers, to build products on top of data like Netflix recommendations and self-driving cars.

#### Growth

- PM focus on getting new users by growing the product through features that drive adoption, either directly or indirectly.
- PM need to understand funnel optimization, acquisition, and onboarding strategies.

#### Internationalization

- PM focus on brining the product to new places.
- PM need to understand the differences in those markets, differences in user behavior, and expectations and adopting the product to fit. Like adding feature to support RTL writing.

## Product phases

- Knowing that multiple products can be worked on at the same time at different phases

### Identifying problems and requirements

#### Identifying Opportunities

- Although there are many problems, PM needs to identify which problem that deserves the effort. Choosing the right problem can be critical in the product success.
- It is not possible to fix every problem being faced, not all problems have the same impact.
- There are several ways to figure out which problem to solve:
	- **Research**: to leverage insights and data to create hypotheses and test them.
		- Stakeholder interviews:
			- Helps to get a better understanding of the business objectives and requirements.
		- Market: 
			- To understand the current space.
			- Know the products and related products in the field.
			- Understand how the competition is.
			- Aware with the trends.
		- User: 
			- To understand the user customs and cultures.
			- Do interviews to receive feedback
			- Deepen the understanding of the user and his needs.
	- **Existing product data**:
		- To understand whether the product is being used.
		- Analyze the reasons that the users might not be using the product for.
		- Figure out ideas or features that can improve the product adoption.
	- **Support team data**:
		- To have an understanding of the common issues that the users face.
		- Detect trends in complaints
		- Be able to prioritize the issues that require fixing. That can help in reducing the cost of providing support.
	- **Efficiency gains**:
		- Something that results in a process being less expensive to complete (shorter amount of time, less money, etc).
		- For ex: Automate tedious tasks whenever possible to free up more bandwidth in their capacity.
		- This will provide space for scalability and value over time
	- **Tie with Business goals**:
		- Fixing the problem should meet with the business goals.
		- Business goals can be:
			- Increase Revenue
			- Add new users
			- Improve engagement
			- Reduce Costs
			- Reduce Churn
- It is possible to change the product, choose a different problem, or even shuffle the team, but it is not possible to control the market

#### Understanding the market

- It is very important to understand the market, identify which market is better and create a product that satisfies this market.
- Product/Market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.
- Market can be measured with:
	- **Size**: As the need is higher, the easier to monetize the product.
	- **Growth**: Does this demand is expected to be increasing.
	- **Acquisition**: How easy to acquire new users?
- Gain a better understanding of the market by:
	- Online research
	- Headlines & News
	- Similar products
	- Trends
		- [Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends](https://www.bondcap.com)
		- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com)
	- Talk to users and customers
- Evaluate [Product/Market Fit](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit-2/):
	- No Product/Market Fit:
		- Users aren't getting value
		- No word of mouth
		- No press buzz
		- Slow growth
	- Product/Market Fit:
		- Users get a lot of value.
		- Product practically sells itself.
		- Press is reaching out to talk to you about your product.
		- Product in high demand.

#### Finding a target user

- Target user is the user you are designing your product for and the user you expect to use it.
- A target user represents a group of users with shared characteristics.
- **Research**:
	- Review data including market research.
	-  Perform interviews.
	-  Conduct surveys.
	-  Run focus groups.
	-  Review existing customer data.
- **User Characteristics**: Once have data, look into their characteristics for trends:
	- Demographics
	-  Motivations
	-  Goals
	-  Frustrations
- **User Personas**
	- A user persona is a fictional person that you create who might use your product. 
	- Once identified trends across these characteristics, create user personas to represent them.
	- Creating a Persona:
		1.  Start by creating a name for your persona.
		2.  Include a photo, or illustration, of what this user might look like.
		3.  Add a quote with a key insight about this user.
		4.  Include a description of the user with details that are relevant to your product.
		5.  Outline the user's goals.
		6.  Describe what motivates the user.
	- Throughout the product development, it is needed to refer back to the personas, in order to stress test and challenge some of the ideas.

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

- TAM is a measure of the revenue opportunity for a product.
- TAM doesn’t predict the future sales. It’s an estimate of the potential size of the market.

##### Calculating TAM
- TAM = Average revenue per user (ARPU) X total number of potential users in the market
- There are several approaches to calculating TAM:
	- **Top Down**:
		- Start with a high level view of the economy, and then narrow that down based on factors like demographics.
		- For example, you will usually start with everyone in the world and narrow down that audience to people who are interested in your product.
		- Example: Water bottle company
			- 7.8 billion people on Earth
			- 330 million people in the US
			- 2 liters per day
			- $1 per liter
			- (330 million people) x (2 liters per day) x ($1 per liter) x (365 days per year)= $241B
	- **Bottoms Up**:
		- Use known data points that you have (data from early customers and sales) that you could extrapolate to represent a larger market opportunity.
		- For example, if you are already selling a product in one region and were considering selling it globally.
		- Example: Water bottle company
			- 330 million people in the US  
			- 25% of population buys one liter per day  
			- $1 per liter  
			- (330 million people) x (25% of people) x ($1 per liter) x (365 days per year)= $30.1B
	- **Value Theory**:
		- Used for new product categories where you don’t have much information to base estimates on.
		- This involves conducting market research to understand how much people would pay for your product and how many potential customers you have.
		- TAM = Price x People who would purchase

#### Return on Investment (ROI)

- It is a measure on how efficient to invest in a product.
- It helps to determine which problem worth solving.
- It is the ratio between the net profit and amount of investment.
- Projects with positive ROI will cover the investment required to build the product.
- A high ROI indicates more impact with less effort.
- Rule:
	- Generic $$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{amount gained} - \text{amount spent}}{\text{amount spent}}$$
	- For software products $$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{impact} - \text{cost of development time}}{\text{cost of development time}}$$
	- Key points:
		- `Amount gained`: can be increase in sales or decrease in costs.
		- `Cost of development time`: Can be measure by how many employees are involved and for how long.
- ROI calculations might require involvement of Finance or Data Science teams to avoid any wrong calculations.

#### Payback Period

- Payback period measures the amount of time that it takes for a product to recoup the initial investment required to build it.
 $$\text{Payback Period}=Cost/(\frac{Time}{Impact​})$$

#### Creating a hypothesis

- Hypotheses helps in making sure that the assumptions are correct, and that the product is solving a real problem for real people.
- After creating hypotheses, they need to be tested to make sure they are true in the real world.
- **Hypothesis types**:
	- Customer Need
		- What are the specific goals that the customers are trying to reach?
		- Is this a real problem?
		- Is there urgency for solving this problem?
		- Where is the opportunity to help them reach their goals?
		- Is the product a Painkiller, which provides an immediate relief? Or is it a vitamin, which is nice to have?
			- It’s important to understand the urgency of the problem.
	- The Solution:
		- Does the solution help the customers meet their needs?
		- What alternatives does the customer currently have or use to reach their goals?
		- Is this solution much better than other options?
	- Differentiation:
		- How does the product is different compared to other solutions?
		- Does it have an edge that customer will choose it upon others?
	- Value:
		- Does the solution provide ENOUGH value for users?
		- How much will people pay for it?
		- What can you do to increase willingness to pay?
			- It’s important to understand what aspects need to be present in your product to increase willingness to pay.
- **Hypothesis Evaluation**:
	- User interviews:
		- It can work better with a walkthrough of a prototype.
		- The results should have a decision regarding whether the solution will be used or will be considered for purchase.
		- This will give an understanding of how beneficial the solution for the users and how they are perceiving it.
	- Focus groups:
		- A small group of people you can present concepts to in order to see how they react. Generally this will be a diverse group of people and you will have specific questions you’d like to get their feedback on
		- It is different from one to one interviews because focus groups have interaction between the participants. 
		 - Participants build on top of each other's ideas or disagree and provide and alternative views.
		 - PMs should avoid group thinking in which only one idea surfaces within the group.
	 - Surveys:
		 - It is best used for high level questions.
		 - It is used to get feedback from many people.
		 - But it has limited in types of question and how deep the questions can go.
		 - It is better to cooperate with a researcher who can create correct type of questions with minimizing the bias.
	 - Design Sprint:
		 - It helps to stress test into how the problem is framed and further define a solution.
		 - The last step of sprint is to validate, where real users are involved to receive their feedback.
	 - The solution will not have a Product/Market fit, and should be rejected or tweaked if:
		 - It doesn't satisfy a customer need.
		 - It is not differentiated enough compared to other solutions.
		 - There is no willingness to pay.

#### Building a Business Case

- This approach might be required for brand-new products. While for smaller ones, a PRD can sufficient.
- It answers the question on why should the company invest in building this project.
- PM will be needed to justify on why the project worth building to the stakeholder and sponsors.
- Topics to be covered in a business case:
	- Business problem:
	- Benefits
	- Costs
	- Risks
	- Possible solutions
	- Timeline
	- Competition
- Business case should be organized into the following sections:
	- **Executive Summary** 
		- It summarizes the entire document, including the recommendation. 
		- You want to make sure that it has enough detail that if it’s the only thing people read they will understand the justifications for building the product.
		- It’s also the first thing people read and usually the last thing you will write to make sure that everything is cohesive.
	- **Problem Statement**:
		- It explains the problem you are trying to solve, as well as the associated goals.
		- It should also clearly link the problem back to the business strategy and goals.
	- **Analysis of Product Opportunity**:
		- It discusses the merits of why solving the problem is important. 
		- You’ll usually want to touch on the cost of the problem and the size of the opportunity.
		- Additionally, you can discuss what would happen if you didn’t solve the problem.
	- **Possible Solutions**:
		- It will describe the potential solutions to the problem. 
		- For each solution, you should discuss benefits, cost, timeline, and risks.
	- **Recommended Approach**: 
		- It puts forward your recommendation for which solution is the best and why.
- Other tips:
	-   Tailor it to your audience
	-   Shorter is better
	-   Make it interesting
	-   Demonstrate business value

### Creating Solutions

- Search for build strategies on how to solve the problem through creation of the product.
- The solution should be related with the company goals and KPIs.

### Timelines

- It is used to visualize tasks that need to be done to deliver the product. It presents task dependencies, resource allocations, workflows schedules, and deadlines.
- Timelines has a fixed start and end dates. It incorporates sprint cycles with the product's short time strategies.
- Assess the expected timelines according to the design and engineering teams feedback.
- If the product is large, it can be split into milestones. In which each milestone can be a standalone project and the following milestones will add more features into the project.
- Timelines components:
	1. Product Improvements
	2. Resources Management
	3. Risk Management
	4. Deadline

### [Roadmap][1]

- It identifies all the initiatives required for the creation and marketing of a product.
- It is mainly used to visualize product's strategy that is aligned with business goals.
- A roadmap streamlines business goals into strategic and executable paths.
- A roadmap can span across multiple timelines for continuous product development.
- A high-level roadmap explains the strategic course of action, with major milestones that you must complete to deliver your products on time.
- Roadmap components:
	1. Product Goal
	2. Strategic Objectives
	3. Major Features (Epics)
	4. Releases Plans
- Roadmap audiences are:
	- Senior management
	- External investors

### Product Requirement Document (PRD)

- PRD is the most important artifact in product cycle.
- It is the source of truth that answers all question related to:
	- What is being built?
	- Why is it needed?
	- Who is it being build for?
- It drives alignment between the team to reach the same final goal.
- PRD is never done, it is continuously updated as decisions are made and new information becomes available.
- PRD components:
	- Frame the problem
	- Outline the goals
	- Success Metrics
	- Describes the requirements
	- Assumptions
	- Out of scope
	- UI Mocks
	- Risks and Mitigations
	- Support Plan
- Priority Level needs to be mentioned, the below shorthand is common
	- P0: A launch blocking feature. The product will not launch without it
	- P1: A nice to have feature at launch, but not required. If not present at launch, it should be a fast follow
	- P2: A desirable feature
	- P3, P4: Unlikely to get built

### UX Design

- It is important to work closely with the product designer during wireframing.
- PM should provide context, requirements, visuals if possible, so the designer can take decisions. It is possible to provide design opinions and guidance, but it may not be always correct.
- Prototyping
	- Visualizing the UX can help in identifying gaps.
- Once the UX is ready, run usability testing to surface any issues. A/B testing can be better for small changes that usability testing will not fit.

### Implementation

- Make sure that engineering team fully understand the requirements.
- Cover and think of all possible edge cases.
- Get regular status updates to know whether the implementation is on track or the dates are slipping. This will surface any roadblocks that the team is running into so that you can help to remove them.

### Testing

- Review test plans with QA teams to outline which scenarios should be tested, the steps to be taken and the expected behavior.
- After QA team test the product, PM also should test it to find any bugs, and make sure that it meets the expected standards.

### Launch

- PM should work with the PR and marketing team to figure out how to launch the product.
- Launches can be silently or with big announcements by posting blog posts or held press conferences.
- For risks launches, it is advised to have a slow roll-out in phases. To have a chance to check the metrics and data.

### Review

- Check how the launch went. This can include different dimensions like changes in key metrics, users sentiments, or how the team thinks the launch went.
- Identify what can be learned and avoid any mistakes in future ones.

## Product Vision and Strategy

### Vision

- **Vision is**:
	- What your product looks like in its final state.
	- Essence of your product.
	- What your product does and why it matters to users.
	- Can be summarized in a sentence or two.
- **Vision needs to tell a story about**:
	- What you’re building.
	- Who it’s for.
	- Why it matters.
- **Vision should be**:
	 - Inspiring
	 - Ambitious
	 - Easy to explain
	 - Something the team believes in
	 - Something you evolve over time
	 - Something you share out frequently
- **Vision matters because**:
	- It gets the team excited and motivated about building the product. It should be something that pushes the team.
	- It serves as a north star for guiding the team and decision-making. It sets the direction of the product
- **Vision Examples**:
	- Google Wi-Fi: A wireless router that people love
	- Facebook: Connect with friends and the world around you
	- Amazon: Earth's most customer-centric company and a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online
	- [More examples](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/best-examples-of-a-vision-statement.html)
- _Vision will impact every single aspect of your product, so it is important to be thoughtful when you are crafting your vision._

- **Factors to consider**:
	- User needs
		- Who is the target user?
		- What are their needs?
	- Key features
		- What are the primary features that solve the user's need?
		- Will these features result in people using the product?

### Business Models

- A business model describes how a business creates, delivers, and captures value.
- **Business Model Canvas**
	- It captures a number of different components that will impact your ability to create and bring a product to market.
		- Things you need to build the product and their associated costs.
		- The value proposition for your product.
		- Getting your product to your customers and the associated revenue streams.
	- It is a really helpful tool to map out and understand all the components that you need to build a product and a successful business:
		- **Key Partners**: 
			- They help build or deliver the product to users. 
			- Examples:
