## Different ways to build and deliver a fitness tracker and pros and cons of each

1.  Native App Development: Native app development involves building a fitness tracker app using the programming language and tools native to a specific operating system (such as iOS or Android). This approach offers a high level of control and performance, as well as the ability to access device-specific features (such as GPS or camera). However, it can be more time-consuming and costly to develop and maintain separate apps for different platforms.

Pros:

-   High level of control and performance
-   Access to device-specific features
-   Familiar user interface for each platform

Cons:

-   Time-consuming and costly to develop and maintain separate apps for different platforms
-   Limited cross-platform compatibility
-   Requires specific development skills for each platform

2.  Hybrid App Development: Hybrid app development involves building a fitness tracker app using web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and packaging it in a native container for each platform. This approach offers a faster and more cost-effective way to develop a cross-platform app, but may sacrifice some performance and user experience.

Pros:

-   Faster and more cost-effective way to develop a cross-platform app
-   Access to device-specific features
-   Consistent user interface across platforms

Cons:

-   Sacrifices some performance and user experience compared to native apps
-   Limited access to certain device-specific features
-   Requires some native development skills to integrate with device features

3.  Web App Development: Web app development involves building a fitness tracker app as a website optimized for mobile devices. This approach offers the most cross-platform compatibility and can be accessed without requiring users to download an app. However, it may sacrifice some performance and user experience compared to native or hybrid apps.

Pros:

-   Most cross-platform compatibility
-   No app download required
-   Easier to develop and maintain compared to native or hybrid apps

Cons:

-   Sacrifices some performance and user experience compared to native or hybrid apps
-   Limited access to certain device-specific features
-   Requires an internet connection for full functionality

Ultimately, the approach that's best for a fitness tracker app depends on the specific goals, budget, and user needs of the project. It may also be possible to combine different approaches, such as building a native app for the most important features and a web app for additional functionality.## Exercise: Industry Trends
