### Example: Using ROI to Determine Which Problems To Address

You have $5 to spend. Which problems should you solve?

![![//#^Table]]
-   Problem D: **SOLVE** because it has the best ROI and lowest cost
-   Problem A: **DO NOT SOLVE** because it has a lower ROI than Problem D and if you spend $1 to solve Problem D, you don't have enough money to solve Problem A
-   Problem B: **SOLVE** because it has the next highest ROI and you have enough money left to solve it after solving Problem D
-   Problem C: **DO NOT SOLVE** because it has the lowest ROI and if you solve Problem B and Problem D, you don't have enough money to solve it anyway
