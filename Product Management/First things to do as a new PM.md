When you join a new team or company, it can take awhile to ramp up. To get started on a good path, here are the things that I would try to do during my first few weeks on a new team:
-   Company
    -   What the company does
    -   How the company makes money
    -   Short term goals and objectives
    -   Long term goals and objectives
    -   Current projects in flight
-   People
    -   My manager
    -   My manager’s manager
    -   Other PMs
    -   Design partner
    -   Research partner
    -   Eng partner
    -   TPM partner
    -   QA partner
    -   Data Science
    -   Marketing
    -   PR
    -   Sales
    -   Support
    -   Legal & Privacy
    -   Policy
    -   Ops
-   Product Experience
    -   Check out the product’s website
    -   Review the app store listing
    -   Use the product
    -   Journal of my experience using it
    -   Questions that I have about why it is the way it is
    -   List of issues that I encountered while using the product
    -   Get help for the product
    -   Review the support site
    -   Reach out to customer support for help with an issue
    -   Use competitor products
    -   Compare similarities and differences
-   Other
    -   Process
    -   Learn the process for how to get things done
        -   What needs to be reviewed
        -   What requires approval
    -   Shadow support and listen to customer calls

There will be lots to learn! But even while you are ramping up, you can still provide value to the team by providing a fresh perspective on your experience using the product and the issues you ran into. And make sure to ask lots of questions!
