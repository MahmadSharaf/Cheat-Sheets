## Using `import` statement

- Imports working only once per module per session by default. Later imports will do nothing, even the module is changed.
  
  ```py
  # File 'script1' contains the below code
  print(2**100)
  print('Spam!'*10)
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  >>> import script1
  1267650600228229401496703205376
  Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!
  >>> import script1
  >>> import script1
  ```

- This is by design; imports are too expensive operation to repeat more than once per file, per program run. As, imports must find files, compile them to byte code, and run the code.

## Using `reload` function vs `import`

```cmd
>>> import script1
1267650600228229401496703205376
Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!
>>> import script1
>>> from importlib import reload

...Change script1.py in a text edit window to print 2 ** 16..

>>> reload(script1)
65536
Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!
<module 'script1' from '.\\script1.py'>
```

## Using `from` statement vs `import`

- `from` statement in a sense defeats the namespace partitioning purpose of modules—because the from copies variables from one file to another, it can cause same-named variables in the importing file to be overwritten, and won’t warn you if it does. This essentially collapses namespaces together, at least in terms of the copied variables
  
  ```py
  # File 'threenames.py'
  a = 'dead'                      # Define three attributes
  b = 'parrot'                    # Exported to other files
  c = 'sketch'
  print(a, b, c)                  # Also used in this file (in 2.X: print a, b, c)
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  >>> from threenames import a,b
  >>> a
  'dead'
  >>> b
  'parrot'
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  >>> import threenames
  >>> threenames.a
  'dead'
  >>> threenames.c
  'sketch'
  ```

## Using exec to Run Module Files

- The exec(open('module.py').read()) built-in function call is another way to launch files from the interactive prompt without having to import and later reload. Each such exec runs the current version of the code read from a file, without requiring later reloads
  
  ```cmd
  >>> exec(open('script1.py').read())
  win32
  65536
  Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!
  
  ...Change script1.py in a text edit window to print 2 ** 32...
  
  >>> exec(open('script1.py').read())
  win32
  4294967296
  Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!Spam!
  ```
