- The built-in `open` function creates a *Python* file object, which serves as a link to a file residing on the machine. After calling `open`, it can transfer strings of data to and from the associated external file by calling the returned file object’s methods.
- File iterators are best for reading lines.
  - The best way to read lines from a text file is to not read the file at all, files also have an iterator that automatically reads one line at a time in a for loop, list comprehension, or other iteration context.
- Content is strings, not objects
- Files are buffered
  - Buffered means that text written may not be transferred from memory to disk immediately. While closing a file, or running its `flush` method, forces the buffered data to disk.
- Files are seekable
  - They are random-access, meaning that they can be accessed to any specific location.
- `close` is often optional:
  - auto-close on collection:
    - When the object is no longer referenced anywhere in the program. So the files is closed automatically.
    - Small script with short runtime
    - Temporary files used by a single line or expression.
  - on the other hand:
    - `close` is a good habit, especially for script with long runtime.
    - This auto-close-on-collection feature of files is not part of the language definition, it may change over time, may not happen when you expect it to in interactive shells, and may not work the same in other Python implementations.

## Common file operations

```py
open(filename[,mode])

# Create output file ('w' means write and will create a file if it does not exist)
output = open(r'C:\spam', 'w')

# Create input file ('r' means read)
input = open('data', 'r')

# Same as prior line ('r' is the default)
input = open('data')

# Open a file, read and write it
outInput = open('data', 'w+')

# appending text to the end
append = open('data',a)

# Read entire file into a single string
aString = input.read()

# Read up to next N characters (or bytes) into a string
aString = input.read(N)

# Read next line (including \n newline) into a string
aString = input.readline()

# Read entire file into list of line strings (with \n)
aList = input.readlines()

# Write a string of characters (or bytes) into file
output.write(aString)

# Write all line strings in a list into file
output.writelines(aList)

# Manual close (done for you when file is collected)
output.close()

# Flush output buffer to disk without closing
output.flush()

# Change file position to offset N for next operation
anyFile.seek(N)

# File iterators read line by line
for line in open('data'): use line

# Unicode text files (str strings)
open('f.txt', encoding='latin-1')

# bytes files (bytes strings)
open('f.bin', 'rb')

# Converting a string to list
eval(aList)

# Converting a sting to dictionary
eval(aDict)
```

## Storing and Retrieving objects

### Using Conversion

- Objects must be converted to strings before storing.

```py
L = [1,2,3]
D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
X, Y, Z = 43, 44, 45
S = 'Spam'

# Create output text file
F = open('datafile.txt', 'w')
# Terminate lines with \n
F.write(S + '\n')
# Convert numbers to strings
F.write('%s,%s,%s\n' % (X, Y, Z))
# Convert and separate with $
F.write(str(L) + '$' + str(D) + '\n')
F.close()

# Open file
F = open('datafile.txt')

# Read one line
line = F.readline()
# Remove end-of-line
S = line.rstrinp()

# Read one line
line = F.readline()
# Convert string to integers
X, Y, Z = int(i) for i in line.split(',')
# Convert string to List/Dictionary

# Read one line
line = F.readline()
L, D = [eval(i) for i in line.split('$')]
```

### Using Pickle Module

- Using `eval` to convert from strings to objects is a powerful tool. In fact, sometimes it’s too powerful. `eval` will happily run any Python expression—even one that might delete all the files on your computer, given the necessary permissions.
- The pickle module is a more advanced tool that store almost any Python object in a file directly, with no to- or from-string conversion requirement on our part.
- The pickle module performs what is known as *object serialization*.

```py
D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
F = open('datafile.pkl', 'wb')
import pickle
# Pickle any object to file
pickle.dump(D, F)
F.close()

F = open('datafile.pkl', 'rb')
# Load any object from file
E = pickle.load(F)
E
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

### Using JSON Format

- JSON is both programming-language-neutral and supported by a variety of systems.
- JSON does not support as broad a range of Python object types as pickle, but its portability is an advantage in some contexts.
- JSON is so close to Python dictionaries and lists in syntax, the translation to and from Python objects is trivial, and is automated by the json standard library module.

```py
name = dict(first='Bob', last='Smith')
rec  = dict(name=name, job=['dev', 'mgr'], age=40.5)
rec
# {'job': ['dev', 'mgr'], 'name': {'last': 'Smith', 'first': 'Bob'}, 'age': 40.5}

import json
# Convert Dictionary to JSON
S = json.dumps(rec)

# Convert JSON to Dictionary
O = json.loads(S)

# Save dictionary to a file as JSON
json.dump(rec, fp=open('testjson.json', 'w'), indent=4)

# Load JSON file
json.load(open('testjson.txt'))
```

## File Context Managers

- It allows us to wrap file-processing code in a logic layer that ensures that the file will be closed (and if needed, have its output flushed to disk) automatically on exit, instead of relying on the auto-close during garbage collection.
- The `with` context manager scheme ensures release of system resources in all Pythons, and may be more useful for output files to guarantee buffer flushes, but it is also limited to objects that support its protocol

```py
with open(r'C:\code\data.txt') as myfile:
    for line in myfile:
       pass
```

- The `try/finally` statement can provide similar functionality, but at some cost in extra code

```py
myfile = open(r'C:\code\data.txt')
try:
    for line in myfile:
        pass
finally:
    myfile.close()
```

## Binary Bytes Files

- *binary files* represent content as a special bytes string and allow you to access file content unaltered.
- *binary files* are useful for processing media, accessing data created by C programs

```py
# Writing Binary bytes to a file
import struct
packed = struct.pack('>i4sh', 7, b'spam', 8)   # Create packed binary data
packed  # 10 bytes, not objects or text
# b'\x00\x00\x00\x07spam\x00\x08'

file = open('data.bin', 'wb')   # Open binary output file
file.write(packed)  # Write packed binary data
# 10
file.close()
```
