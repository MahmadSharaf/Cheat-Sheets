## Strings

- Immutable (they cannot be changed).
- Sequences (Can be indexed and sliced).

```python
# Join: joins two strings together
result = '1234'.join("567")
===
result = '1234' + '567'
# result = "1234567"

# Methods
s = "apple"
s.startswith("a")
# True
s.endswith("e")
# True
s.isdigit()
# False
s.isspace()
# False
s.lower()
# 'apple'
s.upper()
# 'APPLE'
len(s)
# 5
"box" in "box of life"
# True
1 in [1,2,3]
# True
'abracadabra'.find('cad')
# 4
'badger badger badger mushroom'.count('bad')
# 3
```

### Indexing

```py
s[0]
# 'a'
s[-1]
# 'e'
s[len(s)-1]
# 'e'
s[-2]
# 'p'
```

### Slicing

```py
s[1:3]
# 'pp'
s[1:]
# 'pple'
s[:3]
# 'app'
s[:-1]
# 'appl'
```

- Slicing with step size

```py
s[1:3:2]
# 'p'
s[3:1:-2]
# 'l'
```

### String Mutability

- Strings are Immutable. They can not be changed in place

```py
S = 'Sharaf'

S[0] = 'z'   # Immutable objects cannot be changed
# ...error text omitted...
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

- Ways to change strings

```py
S = 'Sharaf'
'z' + S[1:]   # But we can run expressions to make new objects
# 'zpam'


L = list(S)    # Expand to a list: [...]
L

# ['s', 'h', 'a', 'r', 'a', 'f']

L[2] = 'e'  # Change it in place
''.join(L)  # Join with empty delimiter
# 'sheraf'

S.replace('a','e')
# 'Sheref'
```

- Or use `bytearray`, which is mutable and so may be changed in place. `bytearray` objects aren’t really text strings; they’re sequences of small, 8-bit integers. However, they support most of the same operations as normal strings and print as ASCII characters when displayed.

```py
B = bytearray(b'spam')  # A bytes/list hybrid (ahead)
B.extend(b'eggs')    # 'b' needed in 3.X, not 2.X
B  
# bytearray(b'spameggs')
B.decode()  # Translate to normal string
# 'spameggs'

B[1] = ord('c')
B.decode()
# 'scameggs'
```

### String Conversion Tools

- The `int` function converts a string to a number.
- The `float` function converts a string to a float number.
- The `str` function converts a number to its string representation.
- The `repr` function converts an object to its string representation, but returns the object as a string of code that can be rerun to recreate the object.
- The `eval` function runs a string containing Python expression code.
- The `ord` function converts a character to ASCII or Unicode
- The `chr` function converts an ASCII number to the character.
- The `ascii` function same as repr(), return a string containing a printable representation of an object, but escape the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by repr()

```py
int("42"), str(42)
# (42, '42')

str('spam'), repr('spam')
# ('spam', "'spam'")
```

### String Formatting

Credits to this, goes to "SShah" as an answer to [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52155591/how-to-insert-string-into-a-string-as-a-variable)

There are 5 approaches for achieving this on python (Python 3):

1. Concatenation:

   You can do this using + for joining 2 strings, however you can only concatenate string type data, meaning non string type data needs to be converted to string using the str() function. For example:

   ```py
   print("The Enemy's health is " + str(EnemyHealth) + ". The Enemy is " + EnemyIs + ".")
   # output = "The Enemy's health is 0. The Enemy is dead."
   ```

   or multiplying the same string

   ```py
   print('='*10)
   # ==========
   ```

2. Taking advantage of Python 3's print() function which can take multiple parameter arguments:

   Here your `print()` statement similar to the concatenation statement above, except where ever I use + to concatenate you need to replace it with ,. The advantage of using this, is that different data types will be automatically converted to string, i.e. no longer needing the str() function. For example:

   ```py
   print("The Enemy's health is ", EnemyHealth, ". The Enemy is ", EnemyIs, ".")
   # output = "The Enemy's health is 0. The Enemy is dead."
   ```

3. `%` Operator:

   - Same syntax for `printf` function of c-programming language.
   - Add `%` and one of the types of below table next to it, ex: %d, inside a string. To be replaced with values, beside `%`, where stated after the string.
   - The values, if more than one, should be inside brackets and separated with a comma. Same as tuples.
   - Conversion Types:

      | Code| Meaning|
      | ------ | ------ |
      |d|Decimal (base-10 integer)|
      |i|Integer|
      |o|Octal integer (base 8)|
      |u|Same as d (obsolete: no longer unsigned)|
      |x|Hex integer (base 16)|
      |X|Same as x, but with uppercase letters|
      |e|Floating point with exponent, lowercase|
      |E|Same as e, but uses uppercase letters|
      |f|Floating-point decimal|
      |F|Same as f, but uses uppercase letters|
      |g|Floating-point e or f (defaults to 6 precision-point)|
      |G|Floating-point E or F (defaults to 6 precision-point)|
      |c|Character (int or str)|
      |r|Same as s, but uses repr, not str|
      |s|String (or any object’s str(X) string)|
      |%|Literal % (coded as %%)|

   ```py
   print("The Enemy's health is %d. The Enemy is %s." % (EnemyHealth, EnemyIs))
   # output = "The Enemy's health is 0. The Enemy is dead."
   ```

4. `format()` Method:

   - The `format()` method for python strings.
   - This is a built-in method for all strings in python, which allow you to easily replace the placeholder {} within python strings, with any variables.
   - Unlike modulo operator, this `format()` method doesn't require to express or convert different data types to string, as it would automatically do this.
   - **{[name][component][!conversion][:format_spec]}**
     - **[name]**: indicates which argument from the argument list is inserted into the Python format string in the given location.

        ```py
        print("The Enemy's health is {}. The Enemy is {}.".format(0, 'dead'))
        
        # OR
        
        print("The Enemy's health is {0}. The Enemy is {1}.".format(0, 'dead'))
        
        # OR
        
        print("The Enemy's health is {Health}. The Enemy is {Status}.".format(Health=0, Status='dead'))
        
        # output = "The Enemy's health is 0. The Enemy is dead."
        ```

     - **[component]**: is a string of zero or more “.name” or “[index]” references used to fetch attributes and indexed values of the argument, which may be omitted to use the whole argument value.

       - Access an element inside a list

         ```py
         a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
         '{0[0]}, {0[2]}'.format(a)
         # 'foo, baz'
         ```

       - Access key-reference in dictionary

         ```py
         d = {'key1': 'foo', 'key2': 'bar'}
         
         '{0[key1]}'.format(d)
         # 'foo'

         '{my_dict[key2]}'.format(my_dict=d)
         # 'bar'
         ```

       - Access Object attributes

         ```py
         z = 3+5j

         'real = {0.real}, imag = {0.imag}'.format(z)
         # 'real = 3.0, imag = 5.0'
         ```

   - **[!conversion]**: used to convert string using three different built-in functions

      |Value|Meaning|
      |-----|-------|
      | !s  | Convert with str() |
      | !r  | Convert with repr()|
      | !a  | Convert with ascii()|

      ```py
      '{0!s}'.format(42)
      # '42'
      '{0!r}'.format(42)
      # '42'
      '{0!a}'.format(42)
      # '42'
      ```

   - `:<format_spec>` for advanced string control discussed in the next section. They represented as :[[fill]align][sign][#][0][width][group][.prec][type]

5. F-Strings

   - F-strings are introduced in python 3.6+, , to substitute variables within a string.
   - This method is similar to the the `.format()` method described above, and in my opinion is a better upgrade to the str.format() method.
   - To use this method, state `f` before the opening quote when defining a string and then, within the string use the format, {[variable name goes here]} for this to work.

   ```py
   print(f"The Enemy's health is {EnemyHealth}. The Enemy's tall avg  {EnemyAvg:.2f}.")
   # output = "The Enemy's health is 0. The Enemy's tall avg 181.21."
   ```

   - By using this method, the variable name is being instantiated directly within the curly brackets {}.
   - Limitations:
     - F-string expression can’t contain a backslash (`\`) character. You can get around this limitation by creating a temporary variable that contains the escape sequence you want to insert.
     - An expression in an f-string that is triple-quoted can’t contain comments

### Advanced String Formatting

1. `%` Operator:
   - **%[(key name)][flags][width][.precision]conversion type %values**
    1. **%**: Required. The ‘%’ character, which marks the start of the specifier.
    2. **(key name)**: Optional. A key for indexing the dictionary used on the right side of the expression

         ```py
         '%(name)s' %{'name':'Sharaf'}
         # 'Sharaf'

         reply = """
         My name is %(name)s!
         My age is %(age)s
         """

         values = {'name': 'Sharaf', 'age': 30}
         print(reply % values) 
         # My is Sharaf!
         # My age is 30
         ```

    3. **flags**: Optional. Conversion flags, which affect the result of some conversion types.
       - `#`: The value conversion will use the “alternate form”

         ```py
         "%x" % 17
         # '11'
         "%#x" % 17
         # '0x11
         ```

       - `0`: The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values.

         ```py
         "%03d" % 1
         # '003'
         ```

       - `-`: The converted value is left adjusted (overrides the ‘0’ conversion if both are given).

         ```py
         "%-5d" % 1
         # '1    '
         ```

       - `SPACE`: A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.

         ```py
         '%d' % 1
         # '1'
         '% d' % 1
         # ' 1'
         ```

       - `+`: A sign character ('+' or '-') will precede the conversion (overrides a “space” flag).

         ```py
         '%+d' % 1
         #'+1'
         '%+d' % -1
         #'-1'
         ```

    4. **width**: Optional. Minimum field width. If specified as an ‘*’ (asterisk), the actual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the object to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.

         ```py
         '%10d' %(150)
         # '       150'
         '%*d' %(10,150)
         # '       150'
         ```

    5. **precision**: Optional. Precision, given as a ‘.’ (dot) followed by the precision. If specified as ‘*’ (an asterisk), the actual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the value to convert comes after the precision.

         ```py
         '%.10f' %(1.5)
         # '1.5000000000'
        '%.*f' %(10,1.5)
         # '1.5000000000'
         ```

         ```py
         # 1
         dict = {'Name':'Sharaf','Age':30}
         "My name is %(Name)s and I have %(Age)s years old" %(dict)
         # 'My name is Sharaf and I have 30 years old'

         # 2
         x = 123.456
         f'{x:010}'
         # '000123.456'
         f'{x:10}'
         # '   123.456'
         f'{x:+10}'
         # '  +123.456'
         ```

2. `format()` method:
   - **:[[fill]align][sign][#][0][width][group][.prec][type]**
   1. `:`: Separates the <format_spec> from the rest of the replacement field

   2. **align**: Specifies how to justify values that don’t occupy the entire field width
      - `<`: left-justified
      - `>`: right-justified
      - `^`: centered
      - `=`: (Numeric Only) When numeric output includes a sign, it appears at the left edge of the output field, and padding is placed in between the sign and the number.

         ```py
         '{0:+8d}'.format(123)
         # '    +123'
         '{0:=+8d}'.format(123)
         # '+    123'
         ```

   3. **fill**: Specifies how to pad values that don’t occupy the entire field width

         ```py
         '{0:->8s}'.format('foo')
         # '-----foo'
         '{0:#<8d}'.format(123)
         # '123#####'
         '{0:*^8s}'.format('foo')
         # '**foo***'
         ```

       - If you specify a value for `<fill>`, then you should also include a value for `<align>` as well.

   4. **sign**: Controls whether a leading sign is included for numeric values

      ```py
      '{0:+6d}'.format(123)
      # '  +123'
      '{0:+6d}'.format(-123)
      # '  -123'

      '{0:-6d}'.format(123)
      # '   123'
      '{0:-6d}'.format(-123)
      # '  -123'

      '{0:*> 6d}'.format(123)
      # '** 123'
      '{0:*>6d}'.format(123)
      # '***123'
      '{0:*> 6d}'.format(-123)
      # '**-123'
      ```

   5. **`#`**: The value conversion will use the “alternate form”

      ```py
      '{0:b}, {0:#b}'.format(16)
      # '10000, 0b10000'
      '{0:o}, {0:#o}'.format(16)
      # '20, 0o20'
      '{0:x}, {0:#x}'.format(16)
      # '10, 0x10'
      '{0:.0f}, {0:#.0f}'.format(123)
      # '123, 123.'
      '{0:.0e}, {0:#.0e}'.format(123)
      # '1e+02, 1.e+02'
      ```

   6. **`0`**: The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values instead of ASCII.

      ```py
      '{0:05d}'.format(123)
      # '00123'
      '{0:08.1f}'.format(12.3)
      # '000012.3'
      
      '{0:>06s}'.format('foo')
      # '000foo'

      '{0:*>05d}'.format(123)
      # '**123'
      ```

   7. **width**: Specifies the minimum width of the output

      ```py
      '{0:8s}'.format('foo')
      # 'foo     '
      '{0:8d}'.format(123)
      # '     123'

      '{1:{0}f}'.format(10, 123.456)
      # '123.456000'
      ```

   8. **group**: Specifies a grouping character for numeric output

      ```py
      '{0:,d}'.format(1234567)
      # '1,234,567'
      '{0:_b}'.format(0b111010100001)
      # '1110_1010_0001'
      ```

   9. **.prec**: Specifies the number of digits after the decimal point for floating-point presentation types, and the maximum output width for string presentations types

      ```py
      '{0:8.2f}'.format(1234.5678)
      # ' 1234.57'
      '{0:8.4f}'.format(1.23)
      # '  1.2300'

      '{:.4s}'.format('foobar')
      # 'foob'

      '{2:{0}.{1}f}'.format(10, 2, 123.456)
      # '    123.46'
      ```

   10. **type**: Specifies the presentation type, which is the type of conversion performed on the corresponding argument.

      - Differences between Modulo operator

         |Type| `.format()` Method | `%` Operator |
         | -- | -- | -- |
         | b  | Designates binary integer conversion | Not supported
         | i,u| Not supported | Designates integer conversion
         | c  | Designates character conversion, and the corresponding value must be an integer | Designates character conversion, but the corresponding value may be either an integer or a single-character string
         | g,G| Chooses between floating point or exponential output, but the rules governing the choice are slightly more complicated | Chooses between floating point or exponential output, depending on the magnitude of the exponent and the value specified for `<prec>`|
         |r, a| Not supported (though the functionality is provided by the !r and !a conversion components in the replacement field) | Designates conversion with repr() or ascii(), respectively
         | %  | Converts a numeric argument to a percentage | Inserts a literal '%' character into the output

3. F-string:
   - All the `<format_spec>` components that work with .format() also work with f-strings.

### Strings tips and tricks

- Adding `r` before a string, treating it as a raw.
  
  ```py
  print(r'The n in "\n" will be printed not parsed as a new line')
  # The n in "\n" will be printed not skipped
  ```

- Built-in function `repr()`, converts objects to display strings.
  
  ```py
  repr('lion')
  # "'lion'"
  ```

## Lists

- Mutable: changed in place.
- Index and slice Assignment
- Sequences: supports indexing, slicing, and concatenation.
- Store object references (not copies, unless asked explicitly)

### Mutability

Mutable. That means you can change the items in a list after it has been created.

   ```python
   words = ["echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip"]

   len(words)
   # 4

   words[0]
   # 'echidna'

   words[-1]
   # 'bunyip'

   words + [4, 5.4]
   # ["echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip", 4, 5.4]

   words * 2
   # ["echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip", "echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip"]
   ```

#### Assignment

- Both index and slice assignments are in-place changes—they modify the subject list directly, rather than generating a new list object for the result.

1. Index Assignment

   ```py
   L = [1,2,3,4]
   L[1] = 1
   L
   # [1,1,3,4]
   ```

2. Slice Assignment

   ```py
   L[0:2]=[0,1,2] # Insertion/Replacement
   L
   # [0,1,2,3,4]

   L[1:1] = [0.5] # Insertion
   L
   # [0,0.5,1,2,3,4]

   L[1:2] = [] # Deletion
   L
   # [0,1,2,3,4]
   ```

- It can be though as a combination of two steps:
  - Deletion of the part specified on the left "`L[1:2]`"
  - Insertion of the items on the right "`[0,1,2]`" at the place where the old slice was deleted.
- This isn’t what really happens, but it can help clarify why the number of items inserted doesn’t have to match the number of items deleted.

### Lists Specific Operations

- Growing:

   ```py
   words = ["echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip"] 
   # Adds its argument as a single item to the end of the list.
   words.append("platypus")
   
   # Treats its argument as a sequence and adds each item in the sequence to the end of the list. In other words, it adds a sequence of items to a list.
   words.extend("abc")
   # ['echidna', 'dingo', 'crocodile', 'bunyip', 'platypus', 'a', 'b', 'c']

   # Adds each item of this list to the end of the words list
   words.extend(["kangaroo", "wallaby"])

   # Insert object before index.
   words.insert(1,'a')
   ```

- Searching:

   ```py
   # Return first index of value. Raises ValueError if the value is not present.
   words.index('a')
   # 1
   words.index('a',2)
   # 8
   words.count('a')
   # 2
   ```

- Sorting

   ```py

   # reverse the order of the list
   words.reverse()

   # Sort the list in ascending order
   words.sort()

   # The key argument gives a one-argument function that returns the value to be used in sorting
   words.sort(key=str.lower, reverse=True)
   ```

- Shrinking

   ```py
   words = ["echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip"]
   # delete an item
   words.pop(2)
   # ["echidna", "dingo", "bunyip"]
   words.remove('echidna')
   # ["dingo", "bunyip"]

   del words[i]

   del words[i:j]

   words[i:j] = []

   words.clear()
   ```

### Lists Nesting

```py
M = [[1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]]
```

### Comprehensions and Generators

```py
col2 = [row[1] for row in M] # Collect the items in column 2
# [2, 5, 8]

[row[1] for row in M if row[1] % 2 == 0]  # Filter out odd items
# [2, 8]
```

```py
G = (sum(row) for row in M)   # Create a generator of row sums
next(G)  # iter(G) not required here
# 6
next(G)  # Run the iteration protocol next()
# 15
next(G)
# 24
```

```py
[ord(x) for x in 'spaam'] # List of character ordinals
# [115, 112, 97, 97, 109]
{ord(x) for x in 'spaam'} # Sets remove duplicates
# {112, 97, 115, 109}
{x: ord(x) for x in 'spaam'} # Dictionary keys are unique
# {'p': 112, 'a': 97, 's': 115, 'm': 109}
(ord(x) for x in 'spaam') # Generator of values
# <generator object <genexpr> at 0x000000000254DAB0>
```

## Dictionaries

- They are:
  - Accessed by key, not offset position.
    - They store objects by key instead of by relative position.
  - ~~Unordered~~ Ordered collections starting Python 3.7
  - Variable-length, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily nestable.
    - Can shrink and grow in place (without new copies being made).
    - Can contain any type of object
    - Can be nested into other dictionaries
  - Mutable that can change in place.
  - They are not sequences at all, but are instead known as mappings.
  - Tables of object references (hash tables)
    - Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables (data structures that support very fast retrieval), which start small and grow on demand.
  - They store object references (not copies, unless asked explicitly)
- They are not:
  - Sequences: because there’s no notion of ordering among their items, things like concatenation (an ordered joining) and slicing (extracting a contiguous section) simply don’t apply.

### Common dictionary literals and operations

```py
# Empty dictionary
D = {}

# Two-item dictionary
D = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 40}

# Nesting
E = {'cto': {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 40}}

# Alternative construction techniques:
# Keywords
D = dict(name='Bob', age=40)
# key/value pairs
D = dict([('name', 'Bob'), ('age', 40)])
# zipped key/value pairs
D = dict(zip(keyslist, valueslist))
# key lists
D = dict.fromkeys(['name', 'age'])

# Indexing by key
D['name']
E['cto']['age']

# Membership: key present test
'age' in D
```

### Dictionary methods

```py
# Fetch all keys
D.keys()

# Fetch all values
D.values()

# Fetch all key+value tuples
D.items()

# copy (top-level)
D.copy()

# clear (remove all items)
D.clear()

# merge by keys
D.update(D2)
D |= D2 # Python 3.9

# concatenate two dicts and return a new dictionary
z = x | y          # NOTE: 3.9+ ONLY
z = {**x, **y}     # NOTE: 3.5+

# fetch by key, if absent default (or None)
D.get(key, default?)

# remove by key, if absent default (or error)
D.pop(key, default?)

# Insert key with a value of default. Return key value if present, else default
D.setdefault(key, default?)

# remove/return any (key, value) pair; etc.
D.popitem()

# Get dictionary length
len(D)

# Adding/Changing keys
D[key] = value

# Deleting entries by key
del D[key]
```

### Dictionary comprehensions

```py
D = {x: x*2 for x in range(10)}
# {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 8, 5: 10, 6: 12, 7: 14, 8: 16, 9: 18}
D = {x: x ** 2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]}
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
D = {k: v for (k, v) in zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3])}
# {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'a': 1}
D = {c: c * 4 for c in 'SPAM'}
# {'S': 'SSSS', 'P': 'PPPP', 'A': 'AAAA', 'M': 'MMMM'}
```

### Dictionary views

- `D.keys`, `D.values`, and `D.items`.

   ```py
   D = {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'a': 1}

   K = D.keys()
   # dict_keys(['b', 'c', 'a'])
   V = D.values()
   # dict_values([2, 3, 1])
   D.items()
   dict_items([('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('a', 1)])
   ```

- They are:
  - Iterable,
  - Retain the original order of dictionary components,
  - and reflect future changes.

   ```py
   # Iterable
   for key in D: print(key)
   # b
   # c
   # a

   # reflect future changes
   del D['b']
   list(K)
   # ['c', 'a']
   ```

- They are not:
  - Lists
  - do not directly support operations like indexing or the list sort method,
  - and do not display their items as a normal list when printed

- `D.keys` return set-like object, and support set operations such as intersection and union.
- `D.values` are not set-like, since their items are not necessarily unique or immutable.
- `D.items` results are set-like, if their (key, value) pairs are unique and hashable (immutable).

```py
D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

D.keys() & {'b'} # Intersect keys and set
# {'b'}
D.keys() & {'b': 1} # Intersect keys and dict
# {'b'}
D.keys() | {'b', 'c', 'd'} # # Union keys and set
# {'b', 'c', 'a', 'd'}

D = {'a': 1}

list(D.items()) # Items set-like if hashable
# [('a', 1)]
D.items() | D.keys() # Union view and view
# {('a', 1), 'a'}

D.items() | D # dict treated same as its keys
# {('a', 1), 'a'}

D.items() | {('c', 3), ('d', 4)} # Set of key/value pairs
# {('d', 4), ('a', 1), ('c', 3)}

dict(D.items() | {('c', 3), ('d', 4)}) # dict accepts iterable sets too
# {'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'd': 4}
```

### Dict Nesting

```py
rec = {'name': {'first': 'Bob', 'last': 'Smith'},
           'jobs': ['dev', 'mgr'],
           'age':  40.5}

rec['name']   # 'name' is a nested dictionary
#{'last': 'Smith', 'first': 'Bob'}

rec['name']['last'] # Index the nested dictionary
#'Smith'

rec['jobs']   # 'jobs' is a nested list
#['dev', 'mgr']
rec['jobs'][-1]  # Index the nested list
#'mgr'

rec['jobs'].append('janitor')   # Expand Bob's job description in place
rec
#{'age': 40.5, 'jobs': ['dev', 'mgr', 'janitor'], 'name': {'last': 'Smith', 'first': 'Bob'}}
```

### Dict Tricks

- Although Dictionaries aren't sequential, it can be `Print`ed in order with respect to keys

   ```py
   D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
   # {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}

   Ks = list(Ks)
   Ks.sort()
   for k in Ks: print(k, D[k])
   # a 1
   # b 2
   # c 3

   for key in sorted(D):
      print(key, D[key])
   # a 1
   # b 2
   # c 3
   ```

- Search a dict by value instead of key

   ```py
   table = {'1975': 'Holy Grail',
            '1979': 'Life of Brian',
            '1983': 'The Meaning of Life'}
   [year for (year, title) in table.items() if title == 'Holy Grail']
   # OR
   [year for year in table if table[year] == 'Holy Grail']
   # ['1975']
   ```

### Iteration and Optimization

- In a nutshell, an object is *iterable* if it is either a physically stored sequence in memory, or an object that generates one item at a time in the context of an iteration operation—a sort of “virtual” sequence. More formally, both types of objects are considered *iterable* because they support the *iteration protocol* —they respond to the `iter` call with an object that advances in response to `next` calls and raises an exception when finished producing values.

## Tuples

- Immutable, like `strings` (can't changed in-place)
- Sequential, like `lists` and `strings`
- Ordered collections (main objects positions)
- Accessed by offset (indexing and slicing)
- Arrays of object references (store objects access points or references)
- Functionally, they’re used to represent fixed collections of items: the components of a specific calendar date, for instance.

### Common tuple literals and operations

```py
# Empty tuple
T = ()

# A one-item tuple (not an expression)
T = (0,)

# A four-item tuple
T = (0, 'Ni', 1.2, 3)

# Another four-item tuple (same as prior line)
T = 0, 'Ni', 1.2, 3

# Nested tuples
T = ('Bob', ('dev', 'mgr'))

# Tuple of items in an iterable
T = tuple('spam')

# Index
T[i]

# index of index
T[i][j]

# slice
T[i:j]

# length
len(T)

# Concatenate
T1 + T2

# repeat
T * 3

# Iteration
for x in T: print(x)

# membership
'spam' in T
[x ** 2 for x in T]

# Search
T.index(value,[offset])

# Count
T.count(value)

# Named tuple extension type
namedtuple('Emp', ['name', 'jobs'])
```

### Conversions, methods, and immutability

```py
# Conversion
L = list(T)
T = tuple(L)

# Sorting
L.sort()
T = tuple(L)
# OR
sorted(T)

```

### Tricks

- Immutability applies only to the top level of the tuple itself, not its contents. A list inside a tuple, for instance, can be changed as usual
- Tuples can be used as dictionary keys
- Tuples can be unpacked using *

```py
{*range(4), 4, *(5, 6, 7)}
# {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

## Namedtuples

- A type of container like dictionaries called “namedtuple()” present in module, “collections“.
- They can be used similarly to struct or other common record types, except that they are immutable.
- Like dictionaries the1y contain keys that are hashed to a particular value. But on contrary, it supports both access from key value and iteration, the functionality that dictionaries lack.
- `namedtuples` should be used instead of `tuples` anywhere object notation will make the code more pythonic and more easily readable.

### Common namedtuple literals and operations

```py
# Import from collections module
from collections import namedtuple 

# Declaring namedtuple()  
Student = namedtuple('Student',['name','age','DOB'])

# Adding values  
S = Student('Jack','19','2541997') 

# Access using index  
S[1]
# 19 
      
# Access using key   
S.name
# Jack

# Access using getattr
getattr(S,'DOB')
# 2541997

# _fields :- This function is used to return all the keynames of the namespace declared.
S._fields
('name', 'age', 'DOB')

# _replace() :- This function is used to change the values mapped with the passed keyname.
S._replace(name = 'Manjeet')
# Student(name='Manjeet', age='19', DOB='2541997')
```

### Namedtuple Conversion Operations

```py
# Python code to demonstrate namedtuple() and
# _make(), _asdict() and "**" operator

# importing "collections" for namedtuple()
import collections

# Declaring namedtuple()
Student = collections.namedtuple('Student',['name','age','DOB'])

# Adding values
S = Student('Nandini','19','2541997')

# initializing iterable
li = ['Manjeet', '19', '411997' ]

# initializing dict
di = { 'name' : "Nikhil", 'age' : 19 , 'DOB' : '1391997' }

# using _make() to return namedtuple()
Student._make(li)
# Student(name='Manjeet', age='19', DOB='411997')

# using _asdict() to return an OrderedDict()
S._asdict()
# OrderedDict([('name', 'Nandini'), ('age', '19'), ('DOB', '2541997')]

# using ** operator to return namedtuple from dictionary
Student(**di)
# Student(name='Nikhil', age=19, DOB='1391997')
```

## Sets

- Neither mappings nor sequences
- Mutable, can be changed in place
- Unordered collections of unique and immutable objects.
  - Can be used to filter duplicates out of other collections, though items may be reordered in the process because sets are unordered in general.

```py
X = set('spam')  # Make a set out of a sequence in 2.X and 3.X
Y = {'h', 'a', 'm'} # Make a set with set literals in 3.X and 2.7
```

- Perform order-neutral equality tests by converting to a set before the test, because order doesn’t matter in a set.
  - Two sets are equal if and only if every element of each set is contained in the other, regardless of order.

```py
L1, L2 = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4], [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]
L1 == L2   # Order matters in sequences
# False
set(L1) == set(L2)  # Order-neutral equality
# True
sorted(L1) == sorted(L2)  # Similar but results ordered
# True
'spam' == 'asmp', set('spam') == set('asmp'), sorted('spam') == sorted('asmp')
# (False, True, True)
```

### Sets Operations

- Support the usual mathematical set operations

```py
X = set('spam')
Y = {'h', 'a', 'm'}

X, Y # A tuple of two sets without parentheses
# ({'m', 'a', 'p', 's'}, {'m', 'a', 'h'})

X & Y   # Intersection
# {'m', 'a'}
X | Y   # Union
# {'m', 'h', 'a', 'p', 's'}
X - Y   # Difference
# {'p', 's'}
X > Y   # Superset
# False

X, Y # A tuple of two sets without parentheses
# ({'m', 'a', 'p', 's'}, {'m', 'a', 'h'})

X.intersection(Y)   # Intersection
# {'m', 'a'}
X.union(Y)   # Union
# {'m', 'h', 'a', 'p', 's'}
Y.issubset(X)   # Subset
# False
```

### Sets Comprehensions

```py
# Set comprehensions in 3.X and 2.7
{n ** 2 for n in [1, 2, 3, 4]}  
#{16, 1, 4, 9}

>>> {x for x in 'spam'}                    # Same as: set('spam')
{'m', 's', 'p', 'a'}

# Set of collected expression results
{c * 4 for c in 'spam'}  
# {'pppp', 'aaaa', 'ssss', 'mmmm'}
{c * 4 for c in 'spamham'}
# {'pppp', 'aaaa', 'hhhh', 'ssss', 'mmmm'}

S = {c * 4 for c in 'spam'}
S | {'mmmm', 'xxxx'}
# {'pppp', 'xxxx', 'mmmm', 'aaaa', 'ssss'}
S & {'mmmm', 'xxxx'}
# {'mmmm'}
```

### Sets Tricks

```py
S1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

S1 - {1, 2, 3, 4}   # Empty sets print differently
# set()
type({})   # Because {} is an empty dictionary
# <class 'dict'>

S = set()  # Initialize an empty set
S.add(1.23)
S
# {1.23}
```

- Sets can only contain immutable (a.k.a. “hashable”) object types. Hence, lists and dictionaries cannot be embedded in sets, but tuples can.

```py
S
# {1.23}
S.add([1, 2, 3]) # Only immutable objects work in a set
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
S.add({'a':1})
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'
S.add((1, 2, 3))
S # No list or dict, but tuple OK
# {1.23, (1, 2, 3)}

S | {(4, 5, 6), (1, 2, 3)}   # Union: same as S.union(...)
# {1.23, (4, 5, 6), (1, 2, 3)}
(1, 2, 3) in S   # Membership: by complete values
# True
(1, 4, 3) in S
# False
```

- Sets themselves are mutable, and so cannot be nested in other sets directly. The `frozenset` built-in call works just like set but creates an immutable set that cannot change and thus can be embedded in other sets.

## Common operations/methods for data types

1. `sorted()`: Sorts collections
2. `len()`: Returns the length of a collection
3. `in` membership: test whether an item is in a collection
   1. Strings
   2. Dictionaries
   3. Lists
4. Copying for Mutable objects:
   1. Slice expressions with empty limits (`L[:]`) copy sequences.
   2. The dictionary, set, and list `copy` method (`X.copy()`) copies a dictionary, set, or list (the list’s copy is new as of 3.3).
   3. Some built-in functions, such as list and dict make copies (list(L), dict(D), set(S)).
   4. The `copy` standard library module makes full copies when needed. `import copy; X = copy.deepcopy(Y)`
   - Note: empty-limit slices and the dictionary copy method only make top-level copies; that is, they do not copy nested data structures, if any are present. If you need a complete, fully independent copy of a deeply nested data structure (like the various record structures we’ve coded in recent chapters), use the standard copy module.
5. Comparisons:
   1. Numbers are compared by relative magnitude, after conversion to the common highest type if needed.
   2. Strings are compared lexicographically (by the character set code point values returned by ord), and character by character until the end or first mismatch ("abc" < "ac").
   3. Lists and tuples are compared by comparing each component from left to right, and recursively for nested structures, until the end or first mismatch ([2] > [1, 2]).
   4. Sets are equal if both contain the same items (formally, if each is a subset of the other), and set relative magnitude comparisons apply subset and superset tests.
   5. Dictionaries compare as equal if their sorted (key, value) lists are equal. Relative magnitude comparisons are not supported for dictionaries in Python 3.X.
   6. Nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons (e.g., 1 < 'spam') are errors in Python 3.X.
6. Type objects:
   - Call to the built-in function type(X) returns the type object of object X.
   - Each core type has a built-in name added to support type customization through object-oriented subclassing: `dict, list, str, tuple, int, float, complex, bytes, type, set`, and more.  Calls to these names are really object constructor calls, not simply conversion functions, though you can treat them as simple functions for basic usage.
   - It is possible to do type tests with the isinstance function.

      ```py
      type([1]) == type([])
      type([1]) == list
      isinstance([1], list)

      import types
      def f(): pass
      type(f) == types.FunctionType
      ```
