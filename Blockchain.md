# Blockchain

## What blockchain is

* The term can be used to refer different meanings or things. It is used to refer Bitcoin Blockchain, Ethereum Blockchain or other digital tokens (Smart Contracts). But most of time it is referred for the Distributed Ledger.  
**Distributed Ledger** is a list of transactions that distributed across a number of computers that acts as the ultimate books and records (rather than being stored on central server).

* It is developed to solve the issue of trust between parties.

* It is the technology that supports crypto currencies like Bitcoin.

* Blockchain technology is much like a bag of technologies, much like Lego. From this bag you can take out different pieces and combine them together in a variety of ways to create different results.

* There are two main types of Blockchain, Public and Private that relates to the blockchain architecture based on ownership of the data infrastructure. Permissionless and permissioned relates to architecture based on read and write permissions granted to the participants.
  1. Public blockchain holds a list of transactions that can be written with anyone with no gatekeeper to approve or reject parties who want the right in transactions. And it is the most open form of blockchain where anyone can join, read and write and data is hosted publicly. This is where most cryptocurrency projects focus on.
  2. Private blockchain, has a controlling party who allows participants to read and write transactions. This is where most enterprise blockchain established by corporates, focus on.

## Bitcoin vs Blockchain

* Bitcoin is an application of blockchain. Bitcoin is a digital asset than can be bought or send to someone, can be considered as the currency of the internet. This transaction happens on a peer to peer basis without the involve of a central 3rd party. Adding to this, the transaction is recognized in seconds and may settle within hours.
* Blockchain is a technology that enables the moving of theses assets from one individual to another one.

## How blockchain works

* The traditional transaction is Person A wants to transfer $100 dollars to Person B. Person A orders a third party which is the bank to transfer the money to Person B. The third party verifies whether Person A has sufficient funds, identifies Person's B bank and moves the money minus the fees. This process takes an average of 3 days.
* Blockchain eliminates three elements from the transaction. Firstly, no third party is needed and people can interact with each other directly on peer to peer basis. Secondly, there would be a shorter waiting period with a faster transfer. And thirdly the fees are relatively lower compared to what the third party would collect to facilitate the transaction.

### How Blockchain addresses this in the payment transfer scenario

1. Open Ledger: chain of transactions are open and public to everyone on the network so everyone in the network can see where the money is, how much money each person holds and therefore can determine whether the transaction is valid not.
2. Distributed Ledger: It is a centralized ledger where a chain of transactions are recorded. However, the power of blockchain is we can remove the centralized party and distribute across the participants in the network (called loads). In such that everyone can hold the same ledger in their respective nodes and anyone else who joins the network can hold a copy of the ledger and hold the chain of the transactions. This removes the needs of having a trusted centralized party to hold the ledger. But this leads to a problem in which, all participants needs to see the same version of the ledger.
3. Mining: Any transaction occurs, needs to be published to the network but at this stage the transaction is invalid data and will not be recorded in the ledger. In order for the transactions to be validated and recorded into the ledger, miners will need to be involved. Miners are special nodes who compete amongst themselves to take invalid data transaction and validate it and then put it onto the ledger. The first miner who does that gets a financial reward which in our context is bitcoin. In order to be the first to win, a miner needs to validate the new transaction which is relatively easy as the ledger is open and can be immediately calculated. After that, miners need to find a key which enables miners to lock the new transaction into the previous transaction in the chain. In order to find the key, miners needs to invest computational power and time because the search is random and miners need to keep guessing until the first get the key. This incentive reward makes ensures that collectively the network can agree on the official ledger that should be used by everyone.

### What the benefit of decentralization is

* Allows participants to trust a counterparty without knowing them.
* Trust is based on distributed ledger maintained different parties.
* No one party can manipulate the ledger.

## Forms of blockchain

### 1. Public Chains

* They are truly decentralized and distributed blockchains.
* Participants are often anonymous and each can write, read and verify transaction.
* Every participants has a complete ledger and may review transactions.
* The security of public chains is guaranteed by consensus mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake.
* Deployment of application is relatively easy which allows global access.
* With larger volumes of data, there are operational issues to consider. Longer Time and Higher maintenance cost.

### 2. Private Chains

* They are featured with distributed ledgers without decentralization.
* Controller of the network determines who is eligible to participate and to confirm transactions.
* Members within a private chain are not rewarded with virtual currencies.
* Examples of where private chains provide great value include:
  * Auditing tests within a company or the government
  * In transactions and settlement between banks within a consortium.

### 3. Consortium chains

* They are blockchains with characteristics between public and private chains.
* They are initiated by institutions and practice form of decentralization. Participants are predetermined based on certain criteria and the nodes to confirm a transaction are assigned in advance.
* They allow easy permission control setting.
* They, as an intermediate form of blockchain, reduce the cost of an individual's participation as a node and facilitate the establishment of the system.
* It has been one of the key focus of major financial institutions and technology companies.

Public Chains | Private Chains and Consortium Chains
---|---
|Not suitable for exchanges | More suitable for exchanges |
| Non conductive to financial transactions which require anonymity. <br> Huge data transfer leads to high power and storage requirements. <br> Time lag in transaction recording. | Private and consortium chains employ proprietary networks and have greater control over participants. <br> They are more applicable and extensible in financial business. <br> Transactions costs are kept at lower level. <br> regulators prefer the non-anonymity. |

## Key features of blockchain

* Block chain is distributed and decentralized encrypted data stored in a distributed manner. Each node stores a complete set of the general ledger and can view all transaction data.
* It is encrypted and tamper proof with cryptography and timestamp each proceeds strictly in chronological order. Such irreversibility in time ensures that any attempt to tamper with block chain data will be easily traceable. The consensus mechanism safe guards the data codes and verifies their authenticity even if there are error or tampering with an individual node. The authenticty of the entire block chain ledger can guaranteed given that the majority of nodes carry same information. This features resolves the traditional model reliance on the trustworthiness of intermediaries and prevents fake transactions.
* It is extensible and programmable. It is an open source bottom level technology based on various kinds of extension decentralization antitrust can be achieved. New entities can be easily added to a blockchain in a form of a node without affecting existing nodes. Preconditions of a transaction can be set through code programming so that the transaction will be blocked automatically if it doesn't meet the preconditions. Programmable codes of blockchain as known as smart contracts can satisfy the complex demands in the financial market in a traditional model. In traditional model control mechanisms often cannot detect address risks in a timely manner. Smart contracts in the other hand can ensure early risk detection and risk control.

## Potential Use Cases for Blockchain Technology

* Streamlined supply chains:  
  Blockchain is perfectly suited to the task at hand, with real-time tracking that’s especially appealing to companies with multiple supply chains. Major multinational retailer Walmart has partnered with IBM to work on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, for example, to track food staples from supplier to shelf. Proper implementation of the ledger could also prove valuable for pharmaceutical giants, which are required by law to maintain the chain of custody over every pill.

* Forming smarter predictions:  
  Because all transaction data is stored directly to the ledger, blockchain-based business intelligence and analytics tools are more capable than ever of scraping massive amounts of data and uncovering hidden insights. Some have already started applying the concept for practical needs. The ecosystem is designed to deliver accurate forecasts, putting predictive capabilities in the hands of consumers and smaller private enterprises.

* Building decentralized apps:  
  One of the biggest changes blockchain offers developers is the ability to build decentralized applications (or dApps) that circumvent many problems they have today. Originally created using the Ethereum ERC-20 chain, dApps offer a truly decentralized platform that inherits many of the benefits blockchain provides, including greater democratization, peer-to-peer interactions, and a fully trustless protocol based on consensus. The biggest difference, however, is the way data is stored and accessed. Unlike traditional apps where data is centralized in one location, dApps store transaction and other data directly on blockchain’s distributed ledger, which removes single points of failure and makes for more transparent operation.

* Simplifying the Internet of Things:  
  The Internet of Things represents one of the major pillars of greater automation efforts. Connected ecosystems that can record, process, and share interactions are instrumental in building smarter cities and supporting the coming autonomous vehicle revolution. Blockchain means that the infrastructure has finally caught up with modern IoT capabilities.  
  Distributed ledger technology can record the immense amounts of data produced by IoT systems in a trustless fashion and transparently analyze data points to produce valuable insights. Thanks to its identification, verification, and data transfer abilities, blockchain is perfectly suited for hosting IoT devices for both public and private sector use cases.

* Fortifying identity management:  
  Using blockchain for identity verification gives a new dimension to security, removing verification bottlenecks and providing more accurate results. For instance, Civic’s Secure Identity Platform (SIP) is designed for multi-factor authentication without the need for passwords or usernames and relies instead on biometric information verified by the blockchain ledger.  
  Each user goes through an identity check, creating a verifiable user ID that has been validated.  From there, partnering organizations like banks or governments can review a user’s personal identifying information in an encrypted format.
