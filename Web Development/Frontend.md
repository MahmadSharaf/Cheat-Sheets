## What AJAX is

* AJAX stands for: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
* It allow for content retrieval and display without reloading webpage.
* Asynchronous refers to the fact that the request doesn't block other events from happening. Instead, the page keeps on doing its thing, and then only acts on the data when it gets returned by the server.
* AJAX requests occur in a number of different ways and with varying levels of difficulty. Some require an API key, others use O-off, and some don't use any authentication at all. And, the data returned by a different AJAX request differs too.
* X in AJAX stands for XML which used to be the dominant hierarchical data format. But today, JSON is much more popular, in fact most AJAX requests nowadays are actually a AJAJ request standing for Asynchronous JavaScript And Json request, but it doesn't sound as nice so we still just call them Ajax.
* Embedded within Ajax responses, it's pretty common to see HTML, which websites can use to fill in part part of page.
